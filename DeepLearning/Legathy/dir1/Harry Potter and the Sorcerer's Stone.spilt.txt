THE BOY WHO LIVED

Mr. and Mrs.
part3.0
 Dursley, of number four, Privet Drive,
part4.0
 were proud to say
that they were perfe
part5.0
ctly normal, thank you very much. They 
part6.0
were the last
people you'd expect to be
part7.0
 involved in anything strange or myster
part8.0
ious,
because they just didn't hold wit
part9.0
h such nonsense.

Mr. Dursley was the d
part10.0
irector of a firm called Grunnings, whi
part11.0
ch made
drills. He was a big, beefy man
part12.0
 with hardly any neck, although he did

part13.0
have a very large mustache. Mrs. Dursle
part14.0
y was thin and blonde and had
nearly tw
part15.0
ice the usual amount of neck, which cam
part16.0
e in very useful as she
spent so much o
part17.0
f her time craning over garden fences, 
part18.0
spying on the
neighbors. The Dursleys h
part19.0
ad a small son called Dudley and in the
part20.0
ir
opinion there was no finer boy anywh
part21.0
ere.

The Dursleys had everything they 
part22.0
wanted, but they also had a secret, and
part23.0

their greatest fear was that somebody 
part24.0
would discover it. They didn't
think th
part25.0
ey could bear it if anyone found out ab
part26.0
out the Potters. Mrs.
Potter was Mrs. D
part27.0
ursley's sister, but they hadn't met fo
part28.0
r several years;
in fact, Mrs. Dursley 
part29.0
pretended she didn't have a sister, bec
part30.0
ause her
sister and her good-for-nothin
part31.0
g husband were as unDursleyish as it wa
part32.0
s
possible to be. The Dursleys shuddere
part33.0
d to think what the neighbors would
say
part34.0
 if the Potters arrived in the street. 
part35.0
The Dursleys knew that the
Potters had 
part36.0
a small son, too, but they had never ev
part37.0
en seen him. This boy
was another good 
part38.0
reason for keeping the Potters away; th
part39.0
ey didn't want
Dudley mixing with a chi
part40.0
ld like that.

When Mr. and Mrs. Dursle
part41.0
y woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our
part42.0
 story
starts, there was nothing about 
part43.0
the cloudy sky outside to suggest that

part44.0
strange and mysterious things would soo
part45.0
n be happening all over the
country. Mr
part46.0
. Dursley hummed as he picked out his m
part47.0
ost boring tie for
work, and Mrs. Dursl
part48.0
ey gossiped away happily as she wrestle
part49.0
d a screaming
Dudley into his high chai
part50.0
r.

None of them noticed a large, tawny
part51.0
 owl flutter past the window.

At half 
part52.0
past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his b
part53.0
riefcase, pecked Mrs.
Dursley on the ch
part54.0
eek, and tried to kiss Dudley good-bye 
part55.0
but missed,
because Dudley was now havi
part56.0
ng a tantrum and throwing his cereal at
part57.0
 the
walls. "Little tyke," chortled Mr.
part58.0
 Dursley as he left the house. He got
i
part59.0
nto his car and backed out of number fo
part60.0
ur's drive.

It was on the corner of th
part61.0
e street that he noticed the first sign
part62.0
 of
something peculiar -- a cat reading
part63.0
 a map. For a second, Mr. Dursley
didn'
part64.0
t realize what he had seen -- then he j
part65.0
erked his head around to
look again. Th
part66.0
ere was a tabby cat standing on the cor
part67.0
ner of Privet
Drive, but there wasn't a
part68.0
 map in sight. What could he have been 
part69.0
thinking
of? It must have been a trick 
part70.0
of the light. Mr. Dursley blinked and
s
part71.0
tared at the cat. It stared back. As Mr
part72.0
. Dursley drove around the
corner and u
part73.0
p the road, he watched the cat in his m
part74.0
irror. It was now
reading the sign that
part75.0
 said Privet Drive -- no, looking at th
part76.0
e sign; cats
couldn't read maps or sign
part77.0
s. Mr. Dursley gave himself a little sh
part78.0
ake and
put the cat out of his mind. As
part79.0
 he drove toward town he thought of
not
part80.0
hing except a large order of drills he 
part81.0
was hoping to get that day.

But on the
part82.0
 edge of town, drills were driven out o
part83.0
f his mind by something
else. As he sat
part84.0
 in the usual morning traffic jam, he c
part85.0
ouldn't help
noticing that there seemed
part86.0
 to be a lot of strangely dressed peopl
part87.0
e
about. People in cloaks. Mr. Dursley 
part88.0
couldn't bear people who dressed in
fun
part89.0
ny clothes -- the getups you saw on you
part90.0
ng people! He supposed this
was some st
part91.0
upid new fashion. He drummed his finger
part92.0
s on the steering
wheel and his eyes fe
part93.0
ll on a huddle of these weirdos standin
part94.0
g quite
close by. They were whispering 
part95.0
excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was
enr
part96.0
aged to see that a couple of them weren
part97.0
't young at all; why, that man
had to b
part98.0
e older than he was, and wearing an eme
part99.0
rald-green cloak! The
nerve of him! But
part100.0
 then it struck Mr. Dursley that this w
part101.0
as probably some
silly stunt -- these p
part102.0
eople were obviously collecting for som
part103.0
ething...
yes, that would be it. The tr
part104.0
affic moved on and a few minutes later,
part105.0
 Mr.
Dursley arrived in the Grunnings p
part106.0
arking lot, his mind back on drills.

M
part107.0
r. Dursley always sat with his back to 
part108.0
the window in his office on the
ninth f
part109.0
loor. If he hadn't, he might have found
part110.0
 it harder to concentrate
on drills tha
part111.0
t morning. He didn't see the owls swoop
part112.0
 ing past in broad
daylight, though peo
part113.0
ple down in the street did; they pointe
part114.0
d and gazed
open- mouthed as owl after 
part115.0
owl sped overhead. Most of them had nev
part116.0
er
seen an owl even at nighttime. Mr. D
part117.0
ursley, however, had a perfectly
normal
part118.0
, owl-free morning. He yelled at five d
part119.0
ifferent people. He made
several import
part120.0
ant telephone calls and shouted a bit m
part121.0
ore. He was in a
very good mood until l
part122.0
unchtime, when he thought he'd stretch 
part123.0
his legs
and walk across the road to bu
part124.0
y himself a bun from the bakery.

He'd 
part125.0
forgotten all about the people in cloak
part126.0
s until he passed a group of
them next 
part127.0
to the baker's. He eyed them angrily as
part128.0
 he passed. He didn't
know why, but the
part129.0
y made him uneasy. This bunch were whis
part130.0
pering
excitedly, too, and he couldn't 
part131.0
see a single collecting tin. It was on

part132.0
his way back past them, clutching a lar
part133.0
ge doughnut in a bag, that he
caught a 
part134.0
few words of what they were saying.

"T
part135.0
he Potters, that's right, that's what I
part136.0
 heard yes, their son, Harry"

Mr. Durs
part137.0
ley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He 
part138.0
looked back at the
whisperers as if he 
part139.0
wanted to say something to them, but th
part140.0
ought better
of it.

He dashed back acr
part141.0
oss the road, hurried up to his office,
part142.0
 snapped at his
secretary not to distur
part143.0
b him, seized his telephone, and had al
part144.0
most
finished dialing his home number w
part145.0
hen he changed his mind. He put the
rec
part146.0
eiver back down and stroked his mustach
part147.0
e, thinking... no, he was
being stupid.
part148.0
 Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He
part149.0
 was sure there were
lots of people cal
part150.0
led Potter who had a son called Harry. 
part151.0
Come to think
of it, he wasn't even sur
part152.0
e his nephew was called Harry. He'd nev
part153.0
er even
seen the boy. It might have bee
part154.0
n Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point
part155.0

in worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always g
part156.0
ot so upset at any mention of her
siste
part157.0
r. He didn't blame her -- if he'd had a
part158.0
 sister like that... but all
the same, 
part159.0
those people in cloaks...

He found it 
part160.0
a lot harder to concentrate on drills t
part161.0
hat afternoon and
when he left the buil
part162.0
ding at five o'clock, he was still so w
part163.0
orried that
he walked straight into som
part164.0
eone just outside the door.

"Sorry," h
part165.0
e grunted, as the tiny old man stumbled
part166.0
 and almost fell. It
was a few seconds 
part167.0
before Mr. Dursley realized that the ma
part168.0
n was wearing a
violet cloak. He didn't
part169.0
 seem at all upset at being almost knoc
part170.0
ked to the
ground. On the contrary, his
part171.0
 face split into a wide smile and he sa
part172.0
id in
a squeaky voice that made passers
part173.0
by stare, "Don't be sorry, my dear sir,
part174.0

for nothing could upset me today! Rejo
part175.0
ice, for You-Know-Who has gone at
last!
part176.0
 Even Muggles like yourself should be c
part177.0
elebrating, this happy,
happy day!"

An
part178.0
d the old man hugged Mr. Dursley around
part179.0
 the middle and walked off.

Mr. Dursle
part180.0
y stood rooted to the spot. He had been
part181.0
 hugged by a complete
stranger. He also
part182.0
 thought he had been called a Muggle, w
part183.0
hatever that
was. He was rattled. He hu
part184.0
rried to his car and set off for home, 
part185.0
hoping
he was imagining things, which h
part186.0
e had never hoped before, because he
di
part187.0
dn't approve of imagination.

As he pul
part188.0
led into the driveway of number four, t
part189.0
he first thing he saw --
and it didn't 
part190.0
improve his mood -- was the tabby cat h
part191.0
e'd spotted that
morning. It was now si
part192.0
tting on his garden wall. He was sure i
part193.0
t was the
same one; it had the same mar
part194.0
kings around its eyes.

"Shoo!" said Mr
part195.0
. Dursley loudly. The cat didn't move. 
part196.0
It just gave him a
stern look. Was this
part197.0
 normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wonde
part198.0
red. Trying
to pull himself together, h
part199.0
e let himself into the house. He was st
part200.0
ill
determined not to mention anything 
part201.0
to his wife.

Mrs. Dursley had had a ni
part202.0
ce, normal day. She told him over dinne
part203.0
r all
about Mrs. Next Door's problems w
part204.0
ith her daughter and how Dudley had
lea
part205.0
rned a new word ("Won't!"). Mr. Dursley
part206.0
 tried to act normally. When
Dudley had
part207.0
 been put to bed, he went into the livi
part208.0
ng room in time to
catch the last repor
part209.0
t on the evening news:

"And finally, b
part210.0
ird-watchers everywhere have reported t
part211.0
hat the nation's
owls have been behavin
part212.0
g very unusually today. Although owls n
part213.0
ormally
hunt at night and are hardly ev
part214.0
er seen in daylight, there have been
hu
part215.0
ndreds of sightings of these birds flyi
part216.0
ng in every direction since
sunrise. Ex
part217.0
perts are unable to explain why the owl
part218.0
s have suddenly
changed their sleeping 
part219.0
pattern." The newscaster allowed himsel
part220.0
f a grin.
"Most mysterious. And now, ov
part221.0
er to Jim McGuffin with the weather. Go
part222.0
ing
to be any more showers of owls toni
part223.0
ght, Jim?"

"Well, Ted," said the weath
part224.0
erman, "I don't know about that, but it
part225.0
's not
only the owls that have been act
part226.0
ing oddly today. Viewers as far apart a
part227.0
s
Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been
part228.0
 phoning in to tell me that instead
of 
part229.0
the rain I promised yesterday, they've 
part230.0
had a downpour of shooting
stars! Perha
part231.0
ps people have been celebrating Bonfire
part232.0
 Night early -- it's
not until next wee
part233.0
k, folks! But I can promise a wet night
part234.0
 tonight."

Mr. Dursley sat frozen in h
part235.0
is armchair. Shooting stars all over Br
part236.0
itain?
Owls flying by daylight? Mysteri
part237.0
ous people in cloaks all over the place
part238.0
?
And a whisper, a whisper about the Po
part239.0
tters...

Mrs. Dursley came into the li
part240.0
ving room carrying two cups of tea. It 
part241.0
was
no good. He'd have to say something
part242.0
 to her. He cleared his throat
nervousl
part243.0
y. "Er -- Petunia, dear -- you haven't 
part244.0
heard from your sister
lately, have you
part245.0
?"

As he had expected, Mrs. Dursley lo
part246.0
oked shocked and angry. After all,
they
part247.0
 normally pretended she didn't have a s
part248.0
ister.

"No," she said sharply. "Why?"

part249.0

"Funny stuff on the news," Mr. Dursley
part250.0
 mumbled. "Owls... shooting
stars... an
part251.0
d there were a lot of funny-looking peo
part252.0
ple in town today..."

"So?" snapped Mr
part253.0
s. Dursley.

"Well, I just thought... m
part254.0
aybe... it was something to do with... 
part255.0
you
know... her crowd."

Mrs. Dursley s
part256.0
ipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. 
part257.0
Dursley wondered
whether he dared tell 
part258.0
her he'd heard the name "Potter." He de
part259.0
cided he
didn't dare. Instead he said, 
part260.0
as casually as he could, "Their son --

part261.0
he'd be about Dudley's age now, wouldn'
part262.0
t he?"

"I suppose so," said Mrs. Dursl
part263.0
ey stiffly.

"What's his name again? Ho
part264.0
ward, isn't it?"

"Harry. Nasty, common
part265.0
 name, if you ask me."

"Oh, yes," said
part266.0
 Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribl
part267.0
y. "Yes, I quite
agree."

He didn't say
part268.0
 another word on the subject as they we
part269.0
nt upstairs to bed.
While Mrs. Dursley 
part270.0
was in the bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept 
part271.0
to the bedroom
window and peered down i
part272.0
nto the front garden. The cat was still
part273.0
 there.
It was staring down Privet Driv
part274.0
e as though it were waiting for
somethi
part275.0
ng.

Was he imagining things? Could all
part276.0
 this have anything to do with the
Pott
part277.0
ers? If it did... if it got out that th
part278.0
ey were related to a pair of
-- well, h
part279.0
e didn't think he could bear it.

The D
part280.0
ursleys got into bed. Mrs. Dursley fell
part281.0
 asleep quickly but Mr.
Dursley lay awa
part282.0
ke, turning it all over in his mind. Hi
part283.0
s last, comforting
thought before he fe
part284.0
ll asleep was that even if the Potters 
part285.0
were
involved, there was no reason for 
part286.0
them to come near him and Mrs.
Dursley.
part287.0
 The Potters knew very well what he and
part288.0
 Petunia thought about
them and their k
part289.0
ind.... He couldn't see how he and Petu
part290.0
nia could get
mixed up in anything that
part291.0
 might be going on -- he yawned and tur
part292.0
ned over
-- it couldn't affect them....
part293.0


How very wrong he was.

Mr. Dursley m
part294.0
ight have been drifting into an uneasy 
part295.0
sleep, but the cat
on the wall outside 
part296.0
was showing no sign of sleepiness. It w
part297.0
as sitting as
still as a statue, its ey
part298.0
es fixed unblinkingly on the far corner
part299.0
 of
Privet Drive. It didn't so much as 
part300.0
quiver when a car door slammed on the
n
part301.0
ext street, nor when two owls swooped o
part302.0
verhead. In fact, it was nearly
midnigh
part303.0
t before the cat moved at all.

A man a
part304.0
ppeared on the corner the cat had been 
part305.0
watching, appeared so
suddenly and sile
part306.0
ntly you'd have thought he'd just poppe
part307.0
d out of the
ground. The cat's tail twi
part308.0
tched and its eyes narrowed.

Nothing l
part309.0
ike this man had ever been seen on Priv
part310.0
et Drive. He was tall,
thin, and very o
part311.0
ld, judging by the silver of his hair a
part312.0
nd beard, which
were both long enough t
part313.0
o tuck into his belt. He was wearing lo
part314.0
ng robes,
a purple cloak that swept the
part315.0
 ground, and high-heeled, buckled boots
part316.0
.
His blue eyes were light, bright, and
part317.0
 sparkling behind half-moon
spectacles 
part318.0
and his nose was very long and crooked,
part319.0
 as though it had been
broken at least 
part320.0
twice. This man's name was Albus Dumble
part321.0
dore.

Albus Dumbledore didn't seem to 
part322.0
realize that he had just arrived in a
s
part323.0
treet where everything from his name to
part324.0
 his boots was unwelcome. He was
busy r
part325.0
ummaging in his cloak, looking for some
part326.0
thing. But he did seem to
realize he wa
part327.0
s being watched, because he looked up s
part328.0
uddenly at the cat,
which was still sta
part329.0
ring at him from the other end of the s
part330.0
treet. For
some reason, the sight of th
part331.0
e cat seemed to amuse him. He chuckled 
part332.0
and
muttered, "I should have known."

H
part333.0
e found what he was looking for in his 
part334.0
inside pocket. It seemed to be a
silver
part335.0
 cigarette lighter. He flicked it open,
part336.0
 held it up in the air, and
clicked it.
part337.0
 The nearest street lamp went out with 
part338.0
a little pop. He
clicked it again -- th
part339.0
e next lamp flickered into darkness. Tw
part340.0
elve times
he clicked the Put-Outer, un
part341.0
til the only lights left on the whole s
part342.0
treet
were two tiny pinpricks in the di
part343.0
stance, which were the eyes of the cat

part344.0
watching him. If anyone looked out of t
part345.0
heir window now, even beady-eyed
Mrs. D
part346.0
ursley, they wouldn't be able to see an
part347.0
ything that was happening
down on the p
part348.0
avement. Dumbledore slipped the Put-Out
part349.0
er back inside his
cloak and set off do
part350.0
wn the street toward number four, where
part351.0
 he sat down
on the wall next to the ca
part352.0
t. He didn't look at it, but after a mo
part353.0
ment he
spoke to it.

"Fancy seeing you
part354.0
 here, Professor McGonagall."

He turne
part355.0
d to smile at the tabby, but it had gon
part356.0
e. Instead he was smiling
at a rather s
part357.0
evere-looking woman who was wearing squ
part358.0
are glasses exactly
the shape of the ma
part359.0
rkings the cat had had around its eyes.
part360.0
 She, too, was
wearing a cloak, an emer
part361.0
ald one. Her black hair was drawn into 
part362.0
a tight
bun. She looked distinctly ruff
part363.0
led.

"How did you know it was me?" she
part364.0
 asked.

"My dear Professor, I 've neve
part365.0
r seen a cat sit so stiffly."

"You'd b
part366.0
e stiff if you'd been sitting on a bric
part367.0
k wall all day," said
Professor McGonag
part368.0
all.

"All day? When you could have bee
part369.0
n celebrating? I must have passed a
doz
part370.0
en feasts and parties on my way here."

part371.0

Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.

part372.0

"Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all r
part373.0
ight," she said impatiently.
"You'd thi
part374.0
nk they'd be a bit more careful, but no
part375.0
 -- even the Muggles
have noticed somet
part376.0
hing's going on. It was on their news."
part377.0
 She jerked her
head back at the Dursle
part378.0
ys' dark living-room window. "I heard i
part379.0
t. Flocks
of owls... shooting stars....
part380.0
 Well, they're not completely stupid. T
part381.0
hey
were bound to notice something. Sho
part382.0
oting stars down in Kent -- I'll bet
th
part383.0
at was Dedalus Diggle. He never had muc
part384.0
h sense."

"You can't blame them," said
part385.0
 Dumbledore gently. "We've had precious
part386.0

little to celebrate for eleven years."
part387.0


"I know that," said Professor McGonag
part388.0
all irritably. "But that's no
reason to
part389.0
 lose our heads. People are being downr
part390.0
ight careless, out on
the streets in br
part391.0
oad daylight, not even dressed in Muggl
part392.0
e clothes,
swapping rumors."

She threw
part393.0
 a sharp, sideways glance at Dumbledore
part394.0
 here, as though hoping
he was going to
part395.0
 tell her something, but he didn't, so 
part396.0
she went on. "A
fine thing it would be 
part397.0
if, on the very day YouKnow-Who seems t
part398.0
o have
disappeared at last, the Muggles
part399.0
 found out about us all. I suppose he
r
part400.0
eally has gone, Dumbledore?"

"It certa
part401.0
inly seems so," said Dumbledore. "We ha
part402.0
ve much to be thankful
for. Would you c
part403.0
are for a lemon drop?"

"A what?"

"A l
part404.0
emon drop. They're a kind of Muggle swe
part405.0
et I'm rather fond of"

"No, thank you,
part406.0
" said Professor McGonagall coldly, as 
part407.0
though she didn't
think this was the mo
part408.0
ment for lemon drops. "As I say, even i
part409.0
f
You-Know-Who has gone -"

"My dear Pr
part410.0
ofessor, surely a sensible person like 
part411.0
yourself can call him
by his name? All 
part412.0
this 'You- Know-Who' nonsense -- for el
part413.0
even years I
have been trying to persua
part414.0
de people to call him by his proper nam
part415.0
e:
Voldemort." Professor McGonagall fli
part416.0
nched, but Dumbledore, who was
unsticki
part417.0
ng two lemon drops, seemed not to notic
part418.0
e. "It all gets so
confusing if we keep
part419.0
 saying 'You-Know-Who.' I have never se
part420.0
en any reason
to be frightened of sayin
part421.0
g Voldemort's name.

"I know you haven 
part422.0
't, said Professor McGonagall, sounding
part423.0
 half
exasperated, half admiring. "But 
part424.0
you're different. Everyone knows you're
part425.0

the only one You-Know- oh, all right, 
part426.0
Voldemort, was frightened of."

"You fl
part427.0
atter me," said Dumbledore calmly. "Vol
part428.0
demort had powers I will
never have."


part429.0
"Only because you're too -- well -- nob
part430.0
le to use them."

"It's lucky it's dark
part431.0
. I haven't blushed so much since Madam
part432.0
 Pomfrey
told me she liked my new earmu
part433.0
ffs."

Professor McGonagall shot a shar
part434.0
p look at Dumbledore and said, "The owl
part435.0
s
are nothing next to the rumors that a
part436.0
re flying around. You know what
everyon
part437.0
e's saying? About why he's disappeared?
part438.0
 About what finally
stopped him?"

It s
part439.0
eemed that Professor McGonagall had rea
part440.0
ched the point she was most
anxious to 
part441.0
discuss, the real reason she had been w
part442.0
aiting on a cold, hard
wall all day, fo
part443.0
r neither as a cat nor as a woman had s
part444.0
he fixed
Dumbledore with such a piercin
part445.0
g stare as she did now. It was plain th
part446.0
at
whatever "everyone" was saying, she 
part447.0
was not going to believe it until
Dumbl
part448.0
edore told her it was true. Dumbledore,
part449.0
 however, was choosing
another lemon dr
part450.0
op and did not answer.

"What they're s
part451.0
aying," she pressed on, "is that last n
part452.0
ight Voldemort
turned up in Godric's Ho
part453.0
llow. He went to find the Potters. The 
part454.0
rumor is
that Lily and James Potter are
part455.0
 -- are -- that they're -- dead. "

Dum
part456.0
bledore bowed his head. Professor McGon
part457.0
agall gasped.

"Lily and James... I can
part458.0
't believe it... I didn't want to belie
part459.0
ve it...
Oh, Albus..."

Dumbledore reac
part460.0
hed out and patted her on the shoulder.
part461.0
 "I know... I
know..." he said heavily.
part462.0


Professor McGonagall's voice trembled
part463.0
 as she went on. "That's not all.
They'
part464.0
re saying he tried to kill the Potter's
part465.0
 son, Harry. But -- he
couldn't. He cou
part466.0
ldn't kill that little boy. No one know
part467.0
s why, or how,
but they're saying that 
part468.0
when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Vol
part469.0
demort's
power somehow broke -- and tha
part470.0
t's why he's gone.

Dumbledore nodded g
part471.0
lumly.

"It's -- it's true?" faltered P
part472.0
rofessor McGonagall. "After all he's
do
part473.0
ne... all the people he's killed... he 
part474.0
couldn't kill a little boy?
It's just a
part475.0
stounding... of all the things to stop 
part476.0
him... but how in the
name of heaven di
part477.0
d Harry survive?"

"We can only guess,"
part478.0
 said Dumbledore. "We may never know."

part479.0

Professor McGonagall pulled out a lace
part480.0
 handkerchief and dabbed at her
eyes be
part481.0
neath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave a
part482.0
 great sniff as he took a
golden watch 
part483.0
from his pocket and examined it. It was
part484.0
 a very odd watch.
It had twelve hands 
part485.0
but no numbers; instead, little planets
part486.0
 were moving
around the edge. It must h
part487.0
ave made sense to Dumbledore, though, b
part488.0
ecause
he put it back in his pocket and
part489.0
 said, "Hagrid's late. I suppose it was
part490.0

he who told you I'd be here, by the wa
part491.0
y?"

"Yes," said Professor McGonagall. 
part492.0
"And I don't suppose you're going to
te
part493.0
ll me why you're here, of all places?"

part494.0

"I've come to bring Harry to his aunt 
part495.0
and uncle. They're the only family
he h
part496.0
as left now."

"You don't mean -- you c
part497.0
an't mean the people who live here?" cr
part498.0
ied
Professor McGonagall, jumping to he
part499.0
r feet and pointing at number four.
"Du
part500.0
mbledore -- you can't. I've been watchi
part501.0
ng them all day. You couldn't
find two 
part502.0
people who are less like us. And they'v
part503.0
e got this son -- I saw
him kicking his
part504.0
 mother all the way up the street, scre
part505.0
aming for sweets.
Harry Potter come and
part506.0
 live here!"

"It's the best place for 
part507.0
him," said Dumbledore firmly. "His aunt
part508.0
 and
uncle will be able to explain ever
part509.0
ything to him when he's older. I've
wri
part510.0
tten them a letter."

"A letter?" repea
part511.0
ted Professor McGonagall faintly, sitti
part512.0
ng back down on
the wall. "Really, Dumb
part513.0
ledore, you think you can explain all t
part514.0
his in a
letter? These people will neve
part515.0
r understand him! He'll be famous -- a

part516.0
legend -- I wouldn't be surprised if to
part517.0
day was known as Harry Potter day
in th
part518.0
e future -- there will be books written
part519.0
 about Harry -- every child
in our worl
part520.0
d will know his name!"

"Exactly," said
part521.0
 Dumbledore, looking very seriously ove
part522.0
r the top of his
half-moon glasses. "It
part523.0
 would be enough to turn any boy's head
part524.0
. Famous
before he can walk and talk! F
part525.0
amous for something he won't even
remem
part526.0
ber! CarA you see how much better off h
part527.0
e'll be, growing up away
from all that 
part528.0
until he's ready to take it?"

Professo
part529.0
r McGonagall opened her mouth, changed 
part530.0
her mind, swallowed, and
then said, "Ye
part531.0
s -- yes, you're right, of course. But 
part532.0
how is the boy
getting here, Dumbledore
part533.0
?" She eyed his cloak suddenly as thoug
part534.0
h she
thought he might be hiding Harry 
part535.0
underneath it.

"Hagrid's bringing him.
part536.0
"

"You think it -- wise -- to trust Ha
part537.0
grid with something as important as
thi
part538.0
s?"

I would trust Hagrid with my life,
part539.0
" said Dumbledore.

"I'm not saying his
part540.0
 heart isn't in the right place," said 
part541.0
Professor
McGonagall grudgingly, "but y
part542.0
ou can't pretend he's not careless. He 
part543.0
does
tend to -- what was that?"

A low 
part544.0
rumbling sound had broken the silence a
part545.0
round them. It grew
steadily louder as 
part546.0
they looked up and down the street for 
part547.0
some sign of a
headlight; it swelled to
part548.0
 a roar as they both looked up at the s
part549.0
ky -- and
a huge motorcycle fell out of
part550.0
 the air and landed on the road in fron
part551.0
t of
them.

If the motorcycle was huge,
part552.0
 it was nothing to the man sitting astr
part553.0
ide
it. He was almost twice as tall as 
part554.0
a normal man and at least five times
as
part555.0
 wide. He looked simply too big to be a
part556.0
llowed, and so wild - long
tangles of b
part557.0
ushy black hair and beard hid most of h
part558.0
is face, he had hands
the size of trash
part559.0
 can lids, and his feet in their leathe
part560.0
r boots were
like baby dolphins. In his
part561.0
 vast, muscular arms he was holding a b
part562.0
undle
of blankets.

"Hagrid," said Dumb
part563.0
ledore, sounding relieved. "At last. An
part564.0
d where did
you get that motorcycle?"


part565.0
"Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sit
part566.0
," said the giant, climbing
carefully o
part567.0
ff the motorcycle as he spoke. "Young S
part568.0
irius Black lent it to
me. I've got him
part569.0
, sir."

"No problems, were there?"

"N
part570.0
o, sir -- house was almost destroyed, b
part571.0
ut I got him out all right
before the M
part572.0
uggles started swarmin' around. He fell
part573.0
 asleep as we was
flyin' over Bristol."
part574.0


Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall b
part575.0
ent forward over the bundle of
blankets
part576.0
. Inside, just visible, was a baby boy,
part577.0
 fast asleep. Under a
tuft of jet-black
part578.0
 hair over his forehead they could see 
part579.0
a curiously
shaped cut, like a bolt of 
part580.0
lightning.

"Is that where -?" whispere
part581.0
d Professor McGonagall.

"Yes," said Du
part582.0
mbledore. "He'll have that scar forever
part583.0
."

"Couldn't you do something about it
part584.0
, Dumbledore?"

"Even if I could, I wou
part585.0
ldn't. Scars can come in handy. I have 
part586.0
one myself
above my left knee that is a
part587.0
 perfect map of the London Underground.
part588.0
 Well
-- give him here, Hagrid -- we'd 
part589.0
better get this over with."

Dumbledore
part590.0
 took Harry in his arms and turned towa
part591.0
rd the Dursleys' house.

"Could I -- co
part592.0
uld I say good-bye to him, sir?" asked 
part593.0
Hagrid. He bent his
great, shaggy head 
part594.0
over Harry and gave him what must have 
part595.0
been a very
scratchy, whiskery kiss. Th
part596.0
en, suddenly, Hagrid let out a howl lik
part597.0
e a
wounded dog.

"Shhh!" hissed Profes
part598.0
sor McGonagall, "you'll wake the Muggle
part599.0
s!"

"S-s-sorry," sobbed Hagrid, taking
part600.0
 out a large, spotted handkerchief and

part601.0
burying his face in it. "But I c-c-can'
part602.0
t stand it -- Lily an' James dead
-- an
part603.0
' poor little Harry off ter live with M
part604.0
uggles -"

"Yes, yes, it's all very sad
part605.0
, but get a grip on yourself, Hagrid, o
part606.0
r
we'll be found," Professor McGonagall
part607.0
 whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly
on 
part608.0
the arm as Dumbledore stepped over the 
part609.0
low garden wall and walked to
the front
part610.0
 door. He laid Harry gently on the door
part611.0
step, took a letter out
of his cloak, t
part612.0
ucked it inside Harry's blankets, and t
part613.0
hen came back to
the other two. For a f
part614.0
ull minute the three of them stood and 
part615.0
looked at
the little bundle; Hagrid's s
part616.0
houlders shook, Professor McGonagall
bl
part617.0
inked furiously, and the twinkling ligh
part618.0
t that usually shone from
Dumbledore's 
part619.0
eyes seemed to have gone out.

"Well," 
part620.0
said Dumbledore finally, "that's that. 
part621.0
We've no business staying
here. We may 
part622.0
as well go and join the celebrations."

part623.0

"Yeah," said Hagrid in a very muffled 
part624.0
voice, "I'll be takin' Sirius his
bike 
part625.0
back. G'night, Professor McGonagall -- 
part626.0
Professor Dumbledore, sir."

Wiping his
part627.0
 streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve, H
part628.0
agrid swung himself
onto the motorcycle
part629.0
 and kicked the engine into life; with 
part630.0
a roar it rose
into the air and off int
part631.0
o the night.

"I shall see you soon, I 
part632.0
expect, Professor McGonagall," said Dum
part633.0
bledore,
nodding to her. Professor McGo
part634.0
nagall blew her nose in reply.

Dumbled
part635.0
ore turned and walked back down the str
part636.0
eet. On the corner he
stopped and took 
part637.0
out the silver Put-Outer. He clicked it
part638.0
 once, and
twelve balls of light sped b
part639.0
ack to their street lamps so that Prive
part640.0
t
Drive glowed suddenly orange and he c
part641.0
ould make out a tabby cat slinking
arou
part642.0
nd the corner at the other end of the s
part643.0
treet. He could just see the
bundle of 
part644.0
blankets on the step of number four.

"
part645.0
Good luck, Harry," he murmured. He turn
part646.0
ed on his heel and with a swish
of his 
part647.0
cloak, he was gone.

A breeze ruffled t
part648.0
he neat hedges of Privet Drive, which l
part649.0
ay silent and
tidy under the inky sky, 
part650.0
the very last place you would expect
as
part651.0
tonishing things to happen. Harry Potte
part652.0
r rolled over inside his
blankets witho
part653.0
ut waking up. One small hand closed on 
part654.0
the letter beside
him and he slept on, 
part655.0
not knowing he was special, not knowing
part656.0
 he was
famous, not knowing he would be
part657.0
 woken in a few hours' time by Mrs.
Dur
part658.0
sley's scream as she opened the front d
part659.0
oor to put out the milk
bottles, nor th
part660.0
at he would spend the next few weeks be
part661.0
ing prodded and
pinched by his cousin D
part662.0
udley... He couldn't know that at this 
part663.0
very
moment, people meeting in secret a
part664.0
ll over the country were holding up
the
part665.0
ir glasses and saying in hushed voices:
part666.0
 "To Harry Potter -- the boy
who lived!
part667.0
"


CHAPTER TWO

THE VANISHING GLASS

N
part668.0
early ten years had passed since the Du
part669.0
rsleys had woken up to find
their nephe
part670.0
w on the front step, but Privet Drive h
part671.0
ad hardly changed at
all. The sun rose 
part672.0
on the same tidy front gardens and lit 
part673.0
up the brass
number four on the Dursley
part674.0
s' front door; it crept into their livi
part675.0
ng
room, which was almost exactly the s
part676.0
ame as it had been on the night when
Mr
part677.0
. Dursley had seen that fateful news re
part678.0
port about the owls. Only the
photograp
part679.0
hs on the mantelpiece really showed how
part680.0
 much time had passed.
Ten years ago, t
part681.0
here had been lots of pictures of what 
part682.0
looked like a
large pink beach ball wea
part683.0
ring different-colored bonnets -- but D
part684.0
udley
Dursley was no longer a baby, and
part685.0
 now the photographs showed a large
blo
part686.0
nd boy riding his first bicycle, on a c
part687.0
arousel at the fair, playing a
computer
part688.0
 game with his father, being hugged and
part689.0
 kissed by his mother.
The room held no
part690.0
 sign at all that another boy lived in 
part691.0
the house, too.

Yet Harry Potter was s
part692.0
till there, asleep at the moment, but n
part693.0
ot for
long. His Aunt Petunia was awake
part694.0
 and it was her shrill voice that made

part695.0
the first noise of the day.

"Up! Get u
part696.0
p! Now!"

Harry woke with a start. His 
part697.0
aunt rapped on the door again.

"Up!" s
part698.0
he screeched. Harry heard her walking t
part699.0
oward the kitchen and then
the sound of
part700.0
 the frying pan being put on the stove.
part701.0
 He rolled onto his
back and tried to r
part702.0
emember the dream he had been having. I
part703.0
t had been a
good one. There had been a
part704.0
 flying motorcycle in it. He had a funn
part705.0
y
feeling he'd had the same dream befor
part706.0
e.

His aunt was back outside the door.
part707.0


"Are you up yet?" she demanded.

"Nea
part708.0
rly," said Harry.

"Well, get a move on
part709.0
, I want you to look after the bacon. A
part710.0
nd don't you
dare let it burn, I want e
part711.0
verything perfect on Duddy's birthday."
part712.0


Harry groaned.

"What did you say?" h
part713.0
is aunt snapped through the door.

"Not
part714.0
hing, nothing..."

Dudley's birthday --
part715.0
 how could he have forgotten? Harry got
part716.0
 slowly out
of bed and started looking 
part717.0
for socks. He found a pair under his be
part718.0
d and,
after pulling a spider off one o
part719.0
f them, put them on. Harry was used to

part720.0
spiders, because the cupboard under the
part721.0
 stairs was full of them, and
that was 
part722.0
where he slept.

When he was dressed he
part723.0
 went down the hall into the kitchen. T
part724.0
he table
was almost hidden beneath all 
part725.0
Dudley's birthday presents. It looked a
part726.0
s
though Dudley had gotten the new comp
part727.0
uter he wanted, not to mention the
seco
part728.0
nd television and the racing bike. Exac
part729.0
tly why Dudley wanted a
racing bike was
part730.0
 a mystery to Harry, as Dudley was very
part731.0
 fat and hated
exercise -- unless of co
part732.0
urse it involved punching somebody. Dud
part733.0
ley's
favorite punching bag was Harry, 
part734.0
but he couldn't often catch him. Harry

part735.0
didn't look it, but he was very fast.


part736.0
Perhaps it had something to do with liv
part737.0
ing in a dark cupboard, but Harry
had a
part738.0
lways been small and skinny for his age
part739.0
. He looked even smaller and
skinnier t
part740.0
han he really was because all he had to
part741.0
 wear were old clothes
of Dudley's, and
part742.0
 Dudley was about four times bigger tha
part743.0
n he was. Harry
had a thin face, knobbl
part744.0
y knees, black hair, and bright green e
part745.0
yes. He
wore round glasses held togethe
part746.0
r with a lot of Scotch tape because of

part747.0
all the times Dudley had punched him on
part748.0
 the nose. The only thing Harry
liked a
part749.0
bout his own appearance was a very thin
part750.0
 scar on his forehead that
was shaped l
part751.0
ike a bolt of lightning. He had had it 
part752.0
as long as he could
remember, and the f
part753.0
irst question he could ever remember as
part754.0
king his Aunt
Petunia was how he had go
part755.0
tten it.

"In the car crash when your p
part756.0
arents died," she had said. "And don't 
part757.0
ask
questions."

Don't ask questions --
part758.0
 that was the first rule for a quiet li
part759.0
fe with the
Dursleys.

Uncle Vernon ent
part760.0
ered the kitchen as Harry was turning o
part761.0
ver the bacon.

"Comb your hair!" he ba
part762.0
rked, by way of a morning greeting.

Ab
part763.0
out once a week, Uncle Vernon looked ov
part764.0
er the top of his newspaper and
shouted
part765.0
 that Harry needed a haircut. Harry mus
part766.0
t have had more haircuts
than the rest 
part767.0
of the boys in his class put

together,
part768.0
 but it made no difference, his hair si
part769.0
mply grew that way --
all over the plac
part770.0
e.

Harry was frying eggs by the time D
part771.0
udley arrived in the kitchen with his
m
part772.0
other. Dudley looked a lot like Uncle V
part773.0
ernon. He had a large pink face,
not mu
part774.0
ch neck, small, watery blue eyes, and t
part775.0
hick blond hair that lay
smoothly on hi
part776.0
s thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often s
part777.0
aid that Dudley
looked like a baby ange
part778.0
l -- Harry often said that Dudley looke
part779.0
d like a
pig in a wig.

Harry put the p
part780.0
lates of egg and bacon on the table, wh
part781.0
ich was difficult
as there wasn't much 
part782.0
room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting h
part783.0
is presents.
His face fell.

"Thirty-si
part784.0
x," he said, looking up at his mother a
part785.0
nd father. "That's two
less than last y
part786.0
ear."

"Darling, you haven't counted Au
part787.0
ntie Marge's present, see, it's here
un
part788.0
der this big one from Mommy and Daddy."
part789.0


"All right, thirty-seven then," said 
part790.0
Dudley, going red in the face.
Harry, w
part791.0
ho could see a huge Dudley tantrum comi
part792.0
ng on, began wolfing down
his bacon as 
part793.0
fast as possible in case Dudley turned 
part794.0
the table over.

Aunt Petunia obviously
part795.0
 scented danger, too, because she said 
part796.0
quickly,
"And we'll buy you another two
part797.0
 presents while we're out today. How's

part798.0
that, popkin? Two more presents. Is tha
part799.0
t all right''

Dudley thought for a mom
part800.0
ent. It looked like hard work. Finally 
part801.0
he said
slowly, "So I'll have thirty ..
part802.0
. thirty..."

"Thirty-nine, sweetums," 
part803.0
said Aunt Petunia.

"Oh." Dudley sat do
part804.0
wn heavily and grabbed the nearest parc
part805.0
el. "All right
then."

Uncle Vernon chu
part806.0
ckled. "Little tyke wants his money's w
part807.0
orth, just like
his father. 'Atta boy, 
part808.0
Dudley!" He ruffled Dudley's hair.

At 
part809.0
that moment the telephone rang and Aunt
part810.0
 Petunia went to answer it
while Harry 
part811.0
and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap 
part812.0
the racing bike, a
video camera, a remo
part813.0
te control airplane, sixteen new comput
part814.0
er games, and
a VCR. He was ripping the
part815.0
 paper off a gold wristwatch when Aunt 
part816.0
Petunia
came back from the telephone lo
part817.0
oking both angry and worried.

"Bad new
part818.0
s, Vernon," she said. "Mrs. Figg's brok
part819.0
en her leg. She can't
take him." She je
part820.0
rked her head in Harry's direction.

Du
part821.0
dley's mouth fell open in horror, but H
part822.0
arry's heart gave a leap. Every
year on
part823.0
 Dudley's birthday, his parents took hi
part824.0
m and a friend out for the
day, to adve
part825.0
nture parks, hamburger restaurants, or 
part826.0
the movies. Every
year, Harry was left 
part827.0
behind with Mrs. Figg, a mad old lady w
part828.0
ho lived two
streets away. Harry hated 
part829.0
it there. The whole house smelled of ca
part830.0
bbage
and Mrs. Figg made him look at ph
part831.0
otographs of all the cats she'd ever
ow
part832.0
ned.

"Now what?" said Aunt Petunia, lo
part833.0
oking furiously at Harry as though he'd
part834.0

planned this. Harry knew he ought to f
part835.0
eel sorry that Mrs. Figg had
broken her
part836.0
 leg, but it wasn't easy when he remind
part837.0
ed himself it would be
a whole year bef
part838.0
ore he had to look at Tibbles, Snowy, M
part839.0
r. Paws, and
Tufty again.

"We could ph
part840.0
one Marge," Uncle Vernon suggested.

"D
part841.0
on't be silly, Vernon, she hates the bo
part842.0
y."

The Dursleys often spoke about Har
part843.0
ry like this, as though he wasn't
there
part844.0
 -- or rather, as though he was somethi
part845.0
ng very nasty that couldn't
understand 
part846.0
them, like a slug.

"What about what's-
part847.0
her-name, your friend -- Yvonne?"

"On 
part848.0
vacation in Majorca," snapped Aunt Petu
part849.0
nia.

"You could just leave me here," H
part850.0
arry put in hopefully (he'd be able to

part851.0
watch what he wanted on television for 
part852.0
a change and maybe even have a go
on Du
part853.0
dley's computer).

Aunt Petunia looked 
part854.0
as though she'd just swallowed a lemon.
part855.0


"And come back and find the house in 
part856.0
ruins?" she snarled.

"I won't blow up 
part857.0
the house," said Harry, but they weren'
part858.0
t listening.

"I suppose we could take 
part859.0
him to the zoo," said Aunt Petunia slow
part860.0
ly, "...
and leave him in the car...."

part861.0

"That car's new, he's not sitting in i
part862.0
t alone...."

Dudley began to cry loudl
part863.0
y. In fact, he wasn't really crying -- 
part864.0
it had
been years since he'd really cri
part865.0
ed -- but he knew that if he screwed up
part866.0

his face and wailed, his mother would 
part867.0
give him anything he wanted.

"Dinky Du
part868.0
ddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him
part869.0
 spoil your special
day!" she cried, fl
part870.0
inging her arms around him.

"I... don'
part871.0
t... want... him... t-t-to come!" Dudle
part872.0
y yelled between huge,
pretend sobs. "H
part873.0
e always sp- spoils everything!" He sho
part874.0
t Harry a nasty
grin through the gap in
part875.0
 his mother's arms.

Just then, the doo
part876.0
rbell rang -- "Oh, good Lord, they're h
part877.0
ere!" said Aunt
Petunia frantically -- 
part878.0
and a moment later, Dudley's best frien
part879.0
d, Piers
Polkiss, walked in with his mo
part880.0
ther. Piers was a scrawny boy with a fa
part881.0
ce
like a rat. He was usually the one w
part882.0
ho held people's arms behind their
back
part883.0
s while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped
part884.0
 pretending to cry at once.

Half an ho
part885.0
ur later, Harry, who couldn't believe h
part886.0
is luck, was sitting in
the back of the
part887.0
 Dursleys' car with Piers and Dudley, o
part888.0
n the way to the
zoo for the first time
part889.0
 in his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't
part890.0
 been able
to think of anything else to
part891.0
 do with him, but before they'd left, U
part892.0
ncle
Vernon had taken Harry aside.

"I'
part893.0
m warning you," he had said, putting hi
part894.0
s large purple face right up
close to H
part895.0
arry's, "I'm warning you now, boy -- an
part896.0
y funny business,
anything at all -- an
part897.0
d you'll be in that cupboard from now u
part898.0
ntil
Christmas."

"I'm not going to do 
part899.0
anything," said Harry, "honestly..

But
part900.0
 Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No on
part901.0
e ever did.

The problem was, strange t
part902.0
hings often happened around Harry and i
part903.0
t was
just no good telling the Dursleys
part904.0
 he didn't make them happen.

Once, Aun
part905.0
t Petunia, tired of Harry coming back f
part906.0
rom the barbers looking
as though he ha
part907.0
dn't been at all, had taken a pair of k
part908.0
itchen scissors
and cut his hair so sho
part909.0
rt he was almost bald except for his ba
part910.0
ngs, which
she left "to hide that horri
part911.0
ble scar." Dudley had laughed himself s
part912.0
illy
at Harry, who spent a sleepless ni
part913.0
ght imagining school the next day,
wher
part914.0
e he was already laughed at for his bag
part915.0
gy clothes and taped glasses.
Next morn
part916.0
ing, however, he had gotten up to find 
part917.0
his hair exactly as it
had been before 
part918.0
Aunt Petunia had sheared it off He had 
part919.0
been given a week
in his cupboard for t
part920.0
his, even though he had tried to explai
part921.0
n that he
couldn't explain how it had g
part922.0
rown back so quickly.

Another time, Au
part923.0
nt Petunia had been trying to force him
part924.0
 into a revolting
old sweater of Dudley
part925.0
's (brown with orange puff balls) -- Th
part926.0
e harder she
tried to pull it over his 
part927.0
head, the smaller it seemed to become, 
part928.0
until
finally it might have fitted a ha
part929.0
nd puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit
H
part930.0
arry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must 
part931.0
have shrunk in the wash and, to
his gre
part932.0
at relief, Harry wasn't punished.

On t
part933.0
he other hand, he'd gotten into terribl
part934.0
e trouble for being found on
the roof o
part935.0
f the school kitchens. Dudley's gang ha
part936.0
d been chasing him as
usual when, as mu
part937.0
ch to Harry's surprise as anyone else's
part938.0
, there he was
sitting on the chimney. 
part939.0
The Dursleys had received a very angry 
part940.0
letter
from Harry's headmistress tellin
part941.0
g them Harry had been climbing school
b
part942.0
uildings. But all he'd tried to do (as 
part943.0
he shouted at Uncle Vernon
through the 
part944.0
locked door of his cupboard) was jump b
part945.0
ehind the big trash
cans outside the ki
part946.0
tchen doors. Harry supposed that the wi
part947.0
nd must have
caught him in mid- jump.


part948.0
But today, nothing was going to go wron
part949.0
g. It was even worth being with
Dudley 
part950.0
and Piers to be spending the day somewh
part951.0
ere that wasn't school,
his cupboard, o
part952.0
r Mrs. Figg's cabbage-smelling living r
part953.0
oom.

While he drove, Uncle Vernon comp
part954.0
lained to Aunt Petunia. He liked to
com
part955.0
plain about things: people at work, Har
part956.0
ry, the council, Harry, the
bank, and H
part957.0
arry were just a few of his favorite su
part958.0
bjects. This morning,
it was motorcycle
part959.0
s.

"... roaring along like maniacs, th
part960.0
e young hoodlums," he said, as a
motorc
part961.0
ycle overtook them.

I had a dream abou
part962.0
t a motorcycle," said Harry, rememberin
part963.0
g suddenly. "It
was flying."

Uncle Ver
part964.0
non nearly crashed into the car in fron
part965.0
t. He turned right
around in his seat a
part966.0
nd yelled at Harry, his face like a gig
part967.0
antic beet
with a mustache: "MOTORCYCLE
part968.0
S DON'T FLY!"

Dudley and Piers snigger
part969.0
ed.

I know they don't," said Harry. "I
part970.0
t was only a dream."

But he wished he 
part971.0
hadn't said anything. If there was one 
part972.0
thing the
Dursleys hated even more than
part973.0
 his asking questions, it was his talki
part974.0
ng
about anything acting in a way it sh
part975.0
ouldn't, no matter if it was in a
dream
part976.0
 or even a cartoon -- they seemed to th
part977.0
ink he might get dangerous
ideas.

It w
part978.0
as a very sunny Saturday and the zoo wa
part979.0
s crowded with families. The
Dursleys b
part980.0
ought Dudley and Piers large chocolate 
part981.0
ice creams at the
entrance and then, be
part982.0
cause the smiling lady in the van had a
part983.0
sked Harry
what he wanted before they c
part984.0
ould hurry him away, they bought him a 
part985.0
cheap
lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, eit
part986.0
her, Harry thought, licking it as they

part987.0
watched a gorilla scratching its head w
part988.0
ho looked remarkably like Dudley,
excep
part989.0
t that it wasn't blond.

Harry had the 
part990.0
best morning he'd had in a long time. H
part991.0
e was careful to
walk a little way apar
part992.0
t from the Dursleys so that Dudley and 
part993.0
Piers, who
were starting to get bored w
part994.0
ith the animals by lunchtime, wouldn't 
part995.0
fall
back on their favorite hobby of hi
part996.0
tting him. They ate in the zoo
restaura
part997.0
nt, and when Dudley had a tantrum becau
part998.0
se his knickerbocker
glory didn't have 
part999.0
enough ice cream on top, Uncle Vernon b
part1000.0
ought him
another one and Harry was all
part1001.0
owed to finish the first.

Harry felt, 
part1002.0
afterward, that he should have known it
part1003.0
 was all too good to
last.

After lunch
part1004.0
 they went to the reptile house. It was
part1005.0
 cool and dark in
there, with lit windo
part1006.0
ws all along the walls. Behind the glas
part1007.0
s, all sorts
of lizards and snakes were
part1008.0
 crawling and slithering over bits of w
part1009.0
ood and
stone. Dudley and Piers wanted 
part1010.0
to see huge, poisonous cobras and thick
part1011.0
,
man-crushing pythons. Dudley quickly 
part1012.0
found the largest snake in the
place. I
part1013.0
t could have wrapped its body twice aro
part1014.0
und Uncle Vernon's car
and crushed it i
part1015.0
nto a trash can -- but at the moment it
part1016.0
 didn't look in
the mood. In fact, it w
part1017.0
as fast asleep.

Dudley stood with his 
part1018.0
nose pressed against the glass, staring
part1019.0
 at the
glistening brown coils.

"Make 
part1020.0
it move," he whined at his father. Uncl
part1021.0
e Vernon tapped on the
glass, but the s
part1022.0
nake didn't budge.

"Do it again," Dudl
part1023.0
ey ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped the gla
part1024.0
ss smartly
with his knuckles, but the s
part1025.0
nake just snoozed on.

"This is boring,
part1026.0
" Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.

Har
part1027.0
ry moved in front of the tank and looke
part1028.0
d intently at the snake. He
wouldn't ha
part1029.0
ve been surprised if it had died of bor
part1030.0
edom itself -- no
company except stupid
part1031.0
 people drumming their fingers on the g
part1032.0
lass trying
to disturb it all day long.
part1033.0
 It was worse than having a cupboard as
part1034.0
 a
bedroom, where the only visitor was 
part1035.0
Aunt Petunia hammering on the door
to w
part1036.0
ake you up; at least he got to visit th
part1037.0
e rest of the house.

The snake suddenl
part1038.0
y opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very s
part1039.0
lowly, it raised
its head until its eye
part1040.0
s were on a level with Harry's.

It win
part1041.0
ked.

Harry stared. Then he looked quic
part1042.0
kly around to see if anyone was
watchin
part1043.0
g. They weren't. He looked back at the 
part1044.0
snake and winked, too.

The snake jerke
part1045.0
d its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudl
part1046.0
ey, then raised
its eyes to the ceiling
part1047.0
. It gave Harry a look that said quite 
part1048.0
plainly:

"I get that all the time.

"I
part1049.0
 know," Harry murmured through the glas
part1050.0
s, though he wasn't sure the
snake coul
part1051.0
d hear him. "It must be really annoying
part1052.0
."

The snake nodded vigorously.

"Wher
part1053.0
e do you come from, anyway?" Harry aske
part1054.0
d.

The snake jabbed its tail at a litt
part1055.0
le sign next to the glass. Harry
peered
part1056.0
 at it.

Boa Constrictor, Brazil.

"Was
part1057.0
 it nice there?"

The boa constrictor j
part1058.0
abbed its tail at the sign again and Ha
part1059.0
rry read on:
This specimen was bred in 
part1060.0
the zoo. "Oh, I see -- so you've never 
part1061.0
been to
Brazil?"

As the snake shook it
part1062.0
s head, a deafening shout behind Harry 
part1063.0
made both of
them jump.

"DUDLEY! MR. D
part1064.0
URSLEY! COME AND LOOK AT THIS SNAKE! YO
part1065.0
U WON'T BELIEVE
WHAT IT'S DOING!"

Dudl
part1066.0
ey came waddling toward them as fast as
part1067.0
 he could.

"Out of the way, you," he s
part1068.0
aid, punching Harry in the ribs. Caught
part1069.0
 by
surprise, Harry fell hard on the co
part1070.0
ncrete floor. What came next happened
s
part1071.0
o fast no one saw how it happened -- on
part1072.0
e second, Piers and Dudley were
leaning
part1073.0
 right up close to the glass, the next,
part1074.0
 they had leapt back with
howls of horr
part1075.0
or.

Harry sat up and gasped; the glass
part1076.0
 front of the boa constrictor's tank
ha
part1077.0
d vanished. The great snake was uncoili
part1078.0
ng itself rapidly, slithering
out onto 
part1079.0
the floor. People throughout the reptil
part1080.0
e house screamed and
started running fo
part1081.0
r the exits.

As the snake slid swiftly
part1082.0
 past him, Harry could have sworn a low
part1083.0
,
hissing voice said, "Brazil, here I c
part1084.0
ome.... Thanksss, amigo."

The keeper o
part1085.0
f the reptile house was in shock.

"But
part1086.0
 the glass," he kept saying, "where did
part1087.0
 the glass go?"

The zoo director himse
part1088.0
lf made Aunt Petunia a cup of strong, s
part1089.0
weet tea
while he apologized over and o
part1090.0
ver again. Piers and Dudley could only

part1091.0
gibber. As far as Harry had seen, the s
part1092.0
nake hadn't done anything except
snap p
part1093.0
layfully at their heels as it passed, b
part1094.0
ut by the time they were
all back in Un
part1095.0
cle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling th
part1096.0
em how it had
nearly bitten off his leg
part1097.0
, while Piers was swearing it had tried
part1098.0
 to
squeeze him to death. But worst of 
part1099.0
all, for Harry at least, was Piers
calm
part1100.0
ing down enough to say, "Harry was talk
part1101.0
ing to it, weren't you,
Harry?"

Uncle 
part1102.0
Vernon waited until Piers was safely ou
part1103.0
t of the house before
starting on Harry
part1104.0
. He was so angry he could hardly speak
part1105.0
. He managed to
say, "Go -- cupboard --
part1106.0
 stay -- no meals," before he collapsed
part1107.0
 into a
chair, and Aunt Petunia had to 
part1108.0
run and get him a large brandy.

Harry 
part1109.0
lay in his dark cupboard much later, wi
part1110.0
shing he had a watch. He
didn't know wh
part1111.0
at time it was and he couldn't be sure 
part1112.0
the Dursleys were
asleep yet. Until the
part1113.0
y were, he couldn't risk sneaking to th
part1114.0
e kitchen
for some food.

He'd lived wi
part1115.0
th the Dursleys almost ten years, ten m
part1116.0
iserable years, as
long as he could rem
part1117.0
ember, ever since he'd been a baby and 
part1118.0
his parents
had died in that car crash.
part1119.0
 He couldn't remember being in the car 
part1120.0
when
his parents had died. Sometimes, w
part1121.0
hen he strained his memory during long

part1122.0
hours in his cupboard, he came up with 
part1123.0
a strange vision: a blinding
flash of g
part1124.0
reen light and a burn- ing pain on his 
part1125.0
forehead. This, he
supposed, was the cr
part1126.0
ash, though he couldn't imagine where a
part1127.0
ll the green
light came from. He couldn
part1128.0
't remember his parents at all. His aun
part1129.0
t and
uncle never spoke about them, and
part1130.0
 of course he was forbidden to ask
ques
part1131.0
tions. There were no photographs of the
part1132.0
m in the house.

When he had been young
part1133.0
er, Harry had dreamed and dreamed of so
part1134.0
me unknown
relation coming to take him 
part1135.0
away, but it had never happened; the
Du
part1136.0
rsleys were his only family. Yet someti
part1137.0
mes he thought (or maybe hoped)
that st
part1138.0
rangers in the street seemed to know hi
part1139.0
m. Very strange strangers
they were, to
part1140.0
o. A tiny man in a violet top hat had b
part1141.0
owed to him once
while out shopping wit
part1142.0
h Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking
part1143.0
 Harry
furiously if he knew the man, Au
part1144.0
nt Petunia had rushed them out of the
s
part1145.0
hop without buying anything. A wild-loo
part1146.0
king old woman dressed all in
green had
part1147.0
 waved merrily at him once on a bus. A 
part1148.0
bald man in a very long
purple coat had
part1149.0
 actually shaken his hand in the street
part1150.0
 the other day and
then walked away wit
part1151.0
hout a word. The weirdest thing about a
part1152.0
ll these
people was the way they seemed
part1153.0
 to vanish the second Harry tried to ge
part1154.0
t a
closer look.

At school, Harry had 
part1155.0
no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's ga
part1156.0
ng hated
that odd Harry Potter in his b
part1157.0
aggy old clothes and broken glasses, an
part1158.0
d
nobody liked to disagree with Dudley'
part1159.0
s gang.


CHAPTER THREE

THE LETTERS FR
part1160.0
OM NO ONE

The escape of the Brazilian 
part1161.0
boa constrictor earned Harry his
longes
part1162.0
t-ever punishment. By the time he was a
part1163.0
llowed out of his cupboard
again, the s
part1164.0
ummer holidays had started and Dudley h
part1165.0
ad already broken his
new video camera,
part1166.0
 crashed his remote control airplane, a
part1167.0
nd, first time
out on his racing bike, 
part1168.0
knocked down old Mrs. Figg as she cross
part1169.0
ed Privet
Drive on her crutches.

Harry
part1170.0
 was glad school was over, but there wa
part1171.0
s no escaping Dudley's gang,
who visite
part1172.0
d the house every single day. Piers, De
part1173.0
nnis, Malcolm, and
Gordon were all big 
part1174.0
and stupid, but as Dudley was the bigge
part1175.0
st and
stupidest of the lot, he was the
part1176.0
 leader. The rest of them were all quit
part1177.0
e
happy to join in Dudley's favorite sp
part1178.0
ort: Harry Hunting.

This was why Harry
part1179.0
 spent as much time as possible out of 
part1180.0
the house,
wandering around and thinkin
part1181.0
g about the end of the holidays, where 
part1182.0
he
could see a tiny ray of hope. When S
part1183.0
eptember came he would be going off
to 
part1184.0
secondary school and, for the first tim
part1185.0
e in his life, he wouldn't be
with Dudl
part1186.0
ey. Dudley had been accepted at Uncle V
part1187.0
ernon's old private
school, Smeltings. 
part1188.0
Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harr
part1189.0
y, on the
other hand, was going to Ston
part1190.0
ewall High, the local public school. Du
part1191.0
dley
thought this was very funny.

"The
part1192.0
y stuff people's heads down the toilet 
part1193.0
the first day at Stonewall,"
he told Ha
part1194.0
rry. "Want to come upstairs and practic
part1195.0
e?"

"No, thanks," said Harry. "The poo
part1196.0
r toilet's never had anything as
horrib
part1197.0
le as your head down it -- it might be 
part1198.0
sick." Then he ran, before
Dudley could
part1199.0
 work out what he'd said.

One day in J
part1200.0
uly, Aunt Petunia took Dudley to London
part1201.0
 to buy his Smeltings
uniform, leaving 
part1202.0
Harry at Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn 't
part1203.0
 as bad as
usual. It turned out she'd b
part1204.0
roken her leg tripping over one of her 
part1205.0
cats,
and she didn't seem quite as fond
part1206.0
 of them as before. She let Harry watch
part1207.0

television and gave him a bit of choco
part1208.0
late cake that tasted as though
she'd h
part1209.0
ad it for several years.

That evening,
part1210.0
 Dudley paraded around the living room 
part1211.0
for the family in
his brand-new uniform
part1212.0
. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats
part1213.0
, orange
knickerbockers, and flat straw
part1214.0
 hats called boaters. They also carried
part1215.0

knobbly sticks, used for hitting each 
part1216.0
other while the teachers weren't
lookin
part1217.0
g. This was supposed to be good trainin
part1218.0
g for later life.

As he looked at Dudl
part1219.0
ey in his new knickerbockers, Uncle Ver
part1220.0
non said
gruffly that it was the proude
part1221.0
st moment of his life. Aunt Petunia bur
part1222.0
st
into tears and said she couldn't bel
part1223.0
ieve it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he
lo
part1224.0
oked so handsome and grown-up. Harry di
part1225.0
dn't trust himself to speak. He
thought
part1226.0
 two of his ribs might already have cra
part1227.0
cked from trying not to
laugh.

There w
part1228.0
as a horrible smell in the kitchen the 
part1229.0
next morning when Harry
went in for bre
part1230.0
akfast. It seemed to be coming from a l
part1231.0
arge metal tub in
the sink. He went to 
part1232.0
have a look. The tub was full of what l
part1233.0
ooked like
dirty rags swimming in gray 
part1234.0
water.

"What's this?" he asked Aunt Pe
part1235.0
tunia. Her lips tightened as they alway
part1236.0
s
did if he dared to ask a question.

"
part1237.0
Your new school uniform," she said.

Ha
part1238.0
rry looked in the bowl again.

"Oh," he
part1239.0
 said, "I didn't realize it had to be s
part1240.0
o wet."

"DotA be stupid," snapped Aunt
part1241.0
 Petunia. "I'm dyeing some of Dudley's 
part1242.0
old
things gray for you. It'll look jus
part1243.0
t like everyone else's when I've
finish
part1244.0
ed."

Harry seriously doubted this, but
part1245.0
 thought it best not to argue. He sat
d
part1246.0
own at the table and tried not to think
part1247.0
 about how he was going to look
on his 
part1248.0
first day at Stonewall High -- like he 
part1249.0
was wearing bits of old
elephant skin, 
part1250.0
probably.

Dudley and Uncle Vernon came
part1251.0
 in, both with wrinkled noses because o
part1252.0
f the
smell from Harry's new uniform. U
part1253.0
ncle Vernon opened his newspaper as
usu
part1254.0
al and Dudley banged his Smelting stick
part1255.0
, which he carried everywhere,
on the t
part1256.0
able.

They heard the click of the mail
part1257.0
 slot and flop of letters on the
doorma
part1258.0
t.

"Get the mail, Dudley," said Uncle 
part1259.0
Vernon from behind his paper.

"Make Ha
part1260.0
rry get it."

"Get the mail, Harry."

"
part1261.0
Make Dudley get it."

"Poke him with yo
part1262.0
ur Smelting stick, Dudley."

Harry dodg
part1263.0
ed the Smelting stick and went to get t
part1264.0
he mail. Three things
lay on the doorma
part1265.0
t: a postcard from Uncle Vernon's siste
part1266.0
r Marge, who was
vacationing on the Isl
part1267.0
e of Wight, a brown envelope that looke
part1268.0
d like a
bill, and -- a letter for Harr
part1269.0
y.

Harry picked it up and stared at it
part1270.0
, his heart twanging like a giant
elast
part1271.0
ic band. No one, ever, in his whole lif
part1272.0
e, had written to him. Who
would? He ha
part1273.0
d no friends, no other relatives -- he 
part1274.0
didn't belong to the
library, so he'd n
part1275.0
ever even got rude notes asking for boo
part1276.0
ks back. Yet
here it was, a letter, add
part1277.0
ressed so plainly there could be no mis
part1278.0
take:

Mr. H. Potter

The Cupboard unde
part1279.0
r the Stairs

4 Privet Drive

Little Wh
part1280.0
inging

Surrey

The envelope was thick 
part1281.0
and heavy, made of yellowish parchment,
part1282.0
 and the
address was written in emerald
part1283.0
-green ink. There was no stamp.

Turnin
part1284.0
g the envelope over, his hand trembling
part1285.0
, Harry saw a purple wax
seal bearing a
part1286.0
 coat of arms; a lion, an eagle, a badg
part1287.0
er, and a snake
surrounding a large let
part1288.0
ter H.

"Hurry up, boy!" shouted Uncle 
part1289.0
Vernon from the kitchen. "What are you

part1290.0
doing, checking for letter bombs?" He c
part1291.0
huckled at his own joke.

Harry went ba
part1292.0
ck to the kitchen, still staring at his
part1293.0
 letter. He handed
Uncle Vernon the bil
part1294.0
l and the postcard, sat down, and slowl
part1295.0
y began to
open the yellow envelope.

U
part1296.0
ncle Vernon ripped open the bill, snort
part1297.0
ed in disgust, and flipped over
the pos
part1298.0
tcard.

"Marge's ill," he informed Aunt
part1299.0
 Petunia. "Ate a funny whelk. --."

"Da
part1300.0
d!" said Dudley suddenly. "Dad, Harry's
part1301.0
 got something!"

Harry was on the poin
part1302.0
t of unfolding his letter, which was wr
part1303.0
itten on the
same heavy parchment as th
part1304.0
e envelope, when it was jerked sharply 
part1305.0
out of
his hand by Uncle Vernon.

"That
part1306.0
's mine!" said Harry, trying to snatch 
part1307.0
it back.

"Who'd be writing to you?" sn
part1308.0
eered Uncle Vernon, shaking the letter 
part1309.0
open
with one hand and glancing at it. 
part1310.0
His face went from red to green faster

part1311.0
than a set of traffic lights. And it di
part1312.0
dn't stop there. Within seconds
it was 
part1313.0
the grayish white of old porridge.

"P-
part1314.0
P-Petunia!" he gasped.

Dudley tried to
part1315.0
 grab the letter to read it, but Uncle 
part1316.0
Vernon held it
high out of his reach. A
part1317.0
unt Petunia took it curiously and read 
part1318.0
the first
line. For a moment it looked 
part1319.0
as though she might faint. She clutched
part1320.0
 her
throat and made a choking noise.


part1321.0
"Vernon! Oh my goodness -- Vernon!"

Th
part1322.0
ey stared at each other, seeming to hav
part1323.0
e forgotten that Harry and
Dudley were 
part1324.0
still in the room. Dudley wasn't used t
part1325.0
o being ignored. He
gave his father a s
part1326.0
harp tap on the head with his Smelting 
part1327.0
stick.

"I want to read that letter," h
part1328.0
e said loudly. want to read it," said
H
part1329.0
arry furiously, "as it's mine."

"Get o
part1330.0
ut, both of you," croaked Uncle Vernon,
part1331.0
 stuffing the letter back
inside its en
part1332.0
velope.

Harry didn't move.

I WANT MY 
part1333.0
LETTER!" he shouted.

"Let me see it!" 
part1334.0
demanded Dudley.

"OUT!" roared Uncle V
part1335.0
ernon, and he took both Harry and Dudle
part1336.0
y by the
scruffs of their necks and thr
part1337.0
ew them into the hall, slamming the
kit
part1338.0
chen door behind them. Harry and Dudley
part1339.0
 promptly had a furious but
silent figh
part1340.0
t over who would listen at the keyhole;
part1341.0
 Dudley won, so Harry,
his glasses dang
part1342.0
ling from one ear, lay flat on his stom
part1343.0
ach to listen at
the crack between door
part1344.0
 and floor.

"Vernon," Aunt Petunia was
part1345.0
 saying in a quivering voice, "look at 
part1346.0
the
address -- how could they possibly 
part1347.0
know where he sleeps? You don't think
t
part1348.0
hey're watching the house?"

"Watching 
part1349.0
-- spying -- might be following us," mu
part1350.0
ttered Uncle Vernon
wildly.

"But what 
part1351.0
should we do, Vernon? Should we write b
part1352.0
ack? Tell them we don't
want --"

Harry
part1353.0
 could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black s
part1354.0
hoes pacing up and down the
kitchen.

"
part1355.0
No," he said finally. "No, we'll ignore
part1356.0
 it. If they don't get an
answer... Yes
part1357.0
, that's best... we won't do anything..
part1358.0
..

"But --"

"I'm not having one in th
part1359.0
e house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when 
part1360.0
we took
him in we'd stamp out that dang
part1361.0
erous nonsense?"

That evening when he 
part1362.0
got back from work, Uncle Vernon did so
part1363.0
mething he'd
never done before; he visi
part1364.0
ted Harry in his cupboard.

"Where's my
part1365.0
 letter?" said Harry, the moment Uncle 
part1366.0
Vernon had squeezed
through the door. "
part1367.0
Who's writing to me?"

"No one. it was 
part1368.0
addressed to you by mistake," said Uncl
part1369.0
e Vernon shortly.
"I have burned it."


part1370.0
"It was not a mistake," said Harry angr
part1371.0
ily, "it had my cupboard on it."

"SILE
part1372.0
NCE!" yelled Uncle Vernon, and a couple
part1373.0
 of spiders fell from the
ceiling. He t
part1374.0
ook a few deep breaths and then forced 
part1375.0
his face into a
smile, which looked qui
part1376.0
te painful.

"Er -- yes, Harry -- about
part1377.0
 this cupboard. Your aunt and I have be
part1378.0
en
thinking... you're really getting a 
part1379.0
bit big for it... we think it might
be 
part1380.0
nice if you moved into Dudley's second 
part1381.0
bedroom.

"Why?" said Harry.

"Don't as
part1382.0
k questions!" snapped his uncle. "Take 
part1383.0
this stuff upstairs,
now."

The Dursley
part1384.0
s' house had four bedrooms: one for Unc
part1385.0
le Vernon and Aunt
Petunia, one for vis
part1386.0
itors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, M
part1387.0
arge), one
where Dudley slept, and one 
part1388.0
where Dudley kept all the toys and thin
part1389.0
gs
that wouldn't fit into his first bed
part1390.0
room. It only took Harry one trip
upsta
part1391.0
irs to move everything he owned from th
part1392.0
e cupboard to this room. He
sat down on
part1393.0
 the bed and stared around him. Nearly 
part1394.0
everything in here was
broken. The mont
part1395.0
h-old video camera was lying on top of 
part1396.0
a small, working
tank Dudley had once d
part1397.0
riven over the next door neighbor's dog
part1398.0
; in the
corner was Dudley's first-ever
part1399.0
 television set, which he'd put his foo
part1400.0
t
through when his favorite program had
part1401.0
 been canceled; there was a large
birdc
part1402.0
age, which had once held a parrot that 
part1403.0
Dudley had swapped at school
for a real
part1404.0
 air rifle, which was up on a shelf wit
part1405.0
h the end all bent
because Dudley had s
part1406.0
at on it. Other shelves were full of bo
part1407.0
oks. They
were the only things in the r
part1408.0
oom that looked as though they'd never 
part1409.0
been
touched.

From downstairs came the
part1410.0
 sound of Dudley bawling at his mother,
part1411.0
 I don't
want him in there... I need th
part1412.0
at room... make him get out...."

Harry
part1413.0
 sighed and stretched out on the bed. Y
part1414.0
esterday he'd have given
anything to be
part1415.0
 up here. Today he'd rather be back in 
part1416.0
his cupboard with
that letter than up h
part1417.0
ere without it.

Next morning at breakf
part1418.0
ast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley 
part1419.0
was in
shock. He'd screamed, whacked hi
part1420.0
s father with his Smelting stick, been

part1421.0
sick on purpose, kicked his mother, and
part1422.0
 thrown his tortoise through the
greenh
part1423.0
ouse roof, and he still didn't have his
part1424.0
 room back. Harry was
thinking about th
part1425.0
is time yesterday and bitterly wishing 
part1426.0
he'd opened the
letter in the hall. Unc
part1427.0
le Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking
part1428.0
 at each
other darkly.

When the mail a
part1429.0
rrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed to be 
part1430.0
trying to be nice
to Harry, made Dudley
part1431.0
 go and get it. They heard him banging 
part1432.0
things with
his Smelting stick all the 
part1433.0
way down the hall. Then he shouted, "Th
part1434.0
ere's
another one! 'Mr. H. Potter, The 
part1435.0
Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive --'"


part1436.0
With a strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leap
part1437.0
t from his seat and ran down the
hall, 
part1438.0
Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon ha
part1439.0
d to wrestle Dudley to the
ground to ge
part1440.0
t the letter from him, which was made d
part1441.0
ifficult by the fact
that Harry had gra
part1442.0
bbed Uncle Vernon around the neck from 
part1443.0
behind. After a
minute of confused figh
part1444.0
ting, in which everyone got hit a lot b
part1445.0
y the
Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon stra
part1446.0
ightened up, gasping for breath, with
H
part1447.0
arry's letter clutched in his hand.

"G
part1448.0
o to your cupboard -- I mean, your bedr
part1449.0
oom," he wheezed at Harry.
"Dudley -- g
part1450.0
o -- just go."

Harry walked round and 
part1451.0
round his new room. Someone knew he had
part1452.0
 moved out
of his cupboard and they see
part1453.0
med to know he hadn't received his firs
part1454.0
t
letter. Surely that meant they'd try 
part1455.0
again? And this time he'd make sure
the
part1456.0
y didn't fail. He had a plan.

The repa
part1457.0
ired alarm clock rang at six o'clock th
part1458.0
e next morning. Harry
turned it off qui
part1459.0
ckly and dressed silently. He mustn't w
part1460.0
ake the
Dursleys. He stole downstairs w
part1461.0
ithout turning on any of the lights.

H
part1462.0
e was going to wait for the postman on 
part1463.0
the corner of Privet Drive and
get the 
part1464.0
letters for number four first. His hear
part1465.0
t hammered as he crept
across the dark 
part1466.0
hall toward the front door --

Harry le
part1467.0
apt into the air; he'd trodden on somet
part1468.0
hing big and squashy on
the doormat -- 
part1469.0
something alive!

Lights clicked on ups
part1470.0
tairs and to his horror Harry realized 
part1471.0
that the
big, squashy something had bee
part1472.0
n his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had be
part1473.0
en
lying at the foot of the front door 
part1474.0
in a sleeping bag, clearly making
sure 
part1475.0
that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd 
part1476.0
been trying to do. He
shouted at Harry 
part1477.0
for about half an hour and then told hi
part1478.0
m to go and make
a cup of tea. Harry sh
part1479.0
uffled miserably off into the kitchen a
part1480.0
nd by the
time he got back, the mail ha
part1481.0
d arrived, right into Uncle Vernon's la
part1482.0
p.
Harry could see three letters addres
part1483.0
sed in green ink.

I want --" he began,
part1484.0
 but Uncle Vernon was tearing the lette
part1485.0
rs into
pieces before his eyes. Uncle V
part1486.0
ernon didnt go to work that day. He
sta
part1487.0
yed at home and nailed up the mail slot
part1488.0
.

"See," he explained to Aunt Petunia 
part1489.0
through a mouthful of nails, "if
they c
part1490.0
an't deliver them they'll just give up.
part1491.0
"

"I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon."
part1492.0


"Oh, these people's minds work in str
part1493.0
ange ways, Petunia, they're not
like yo
part1494.0
u and me," said Uncle Vernon, trying to
part1495.0
 knock in a nail with the
piece of frui
part1496.0
tcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him
part1497.0
.

On Friday, no less than twelve lette
part1498.0
rs arrived for Harry. As they
couldn't 
part1499.0
go through the mail slot they had been 
part1500.0
pushed under the door,
slotted through 
part1501.0
the sides, and a few even forced throug
part1502.0
h the small
window in the downstairs ba
part1503.0
throom.

Uncle Vernon stayed at home ag
part1504.0
ain. After burning all the letters, he 
part1505.0
got
out a hammer and nails and boarded 
part1506.0
up the cracks around the front and
back
part1507.0
 doors so no one could go out. He humme
part1508.0
d "Tiptoe Through the Tulips"
as he wor
part1509.0
ked, and jumped at small noises.

On Sa
part1510.0
turday, things began to get out of hand
part1511.0
. Twenty-four letters to
Harry found th
part1512.0
eir way into the house, rolled up and h
part1513.0
idden inside each
of the two dozen eggs
part1514.0
 that their very confused milkman had h
part1515.0
anded Aunt
Petunia through the living r
part1516.0
oom window. While Uncle Vernon made fur
part1517.0
ious
telephone calls to the post office
part1518.0
 and the dairy trying to find someone
t
part1519.0
o complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded th
part1520.0
e letters in her food processor.

"Who 
part1521.0
on earth wants to talk to you this badl
part1522.0
y?" Dudley asked Harry in
amazement.

O
part1523.0
n Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down
part1524.0
 at the breakfast table looking
tired a
part1525.0
nd rather ill, but happy.

"No post on 
part1526.0
Sundays," he reminded them cheerfully a
part1527.0
s he spread marmalade
on his newspapers
part1528.0
, "no damn letters today --"

Something
part1529.0
 came whizzing down the kitchen chimney
part1530.0
 as he spoke and caught
him sharply on 
part1531.0
the back of the head. Next moment, thir
part1532.0
ty or forty
letters came pelting out of
part1533.0
 the fireplace like bullets. The Dursle
part1534.0
ys
ducked, but Harry leapt into the air
part1535.0
 trying to catch one.

"Out! OUT!"

Unc
part1536.0
le Vernon seized Harry around the waist
part1537.0
 and threw him into the hall.
When Aunt
part1538.0
 Petunia and Dudley had run out with th
part1539.0
eir arms over their
faces, Uncle Vernon
part1540.0
 slammed the door shut. They could hear
part1541.0
 the letters
still streaming into the r
part1542.0
oom, bouncing off the walls and floor.

part1543.0

"That does it," said Uncle Vernon, try
part1544.0
ing to speak calmly but pulling
great t
part1545.0
ufts out of his mustache at the same ti
part1546.0
me. I want you all back
here in five mi
part1547.0
nutes ready to leave. We're going away.
part1548.0
 Just pack some
clothes. No arguments!"
part1549.0


He looked so dangerous with half his 
part1550.0
mustache missing that no one dared
argu
part1551.0
e. Ten minutes later they had wrenched 
part1552.0
their way through the
boarded-up doors 
part1553.0
and were in the car, speeding toward th
part1554.0
e highway.
Dudley was sniffling in the 
part1555.0
back seat; his father had hit him round
part1556.0
 the
head for holding them up while he 
part1557.0
tried to pack his television, VCR, and

part1558.0
computer in his sports bag.

They drove
part1559.0
. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia did
part1560.0
n't dare ask where they
were going. Eve
part1561.0
ry now and then Uncle Vernon would take
part1562.0
 a sharp turn and
drive in the opposite
part1563.0
 direction for a while. "Shake'em off..
part1564.0
. shake 'em
off," he would mutter whene
part1565.0
ver he did this.

They didn't stop to e
part1566.0
at or drink all day. By nightfall Dudle
part1567.0
y was
howling. He'd never had such a ba
part1568.0
d day in his life. He was hungry, he'd

part1569.0
missed five television programs he'd wa
part1570.0
nted to see, and he'd never gone
so lon
part1571.0
g without blowing up an alien on his co
part1572.0
mputer.

Uncle Vernon stopped at last o
part1573.0
utside a gloomy-looking hotel on the
ou
part1574.0
tskirts of a big city. Dudley and Harry
part1575.0
 shared a room with twin beds
and damp,
part1576.0
 musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry 
part1577.0
stayed awake, sitting on
the windowsill
part1578.0
, staring down at the lights of passing
part1579.0
 cars and
wondering....

They ate stale
part1580.0
 cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes on
part1581.0
 toast for
breakfast the next day. They
part1582.0
 had just finished when the owner of th
part1583.0
e
hotel came over to their table.

"'Sc
part1584.0
use me, but is one of you Mr. H. Potter
part1585.0
? Only I got about an 'undred
of these 
part1586.0
at the front desk."

She held up a lett
part1587.0
er so they could read the green ink add
part1588.0
ress:

Mr. H. Potter

Room 17

Railview
part1589.0
 Hotel

Cokeworth

Harry made a grab fo
part1590.0
r the letter but Uncle Vernon knocked h
part1591.0
is hand out
of the way. The woman stare
part1592.0
d.

"I'll take them," said Uncle Vernon
part1593.0
, standing up quickly and following
her
part1594.0
 from the dining room.

Wouldn't it be 
part1595.0
better just to go home, dear?" Aunt Pet
part1596.0
unia suggested
timidly, hours later, bu
part1597.0
t Uncle Vernon didn't seem to hear her.
part1598.0
 Exactly
what he was looking for, none 
part1599.0
of them knew. He drove them into the
mi
part1600.0
ddle of a forest, got out, looked aroun
part1601.0
d, shook his head, got back in
the car,
part1602.0
 and off they went again. The same thin
part1603.0
g happened in the middle
of a plowed fi
part1604.0
eld, halfway across a suspension bridge
part1605.0
, and at the top of
a multilevel parkin
part1606.0
g garage.

"Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he
part1607.0
?" Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late
part1608.0
 that
afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parke
part1609.0
d at the coast, locked them all inside

part1610.0
the car, and disappeared.

It started t
part1611.0
o rain. Great drops beat on the roof of
part1612.0
 the car. Dud ley
sniveled.

"It's Mond
part1613.0
ay," he told his mother. "The Great Hum
part1614.0
berto's on tonight. I
want to stay some
part1615.0
where with a television. "

Monday. Thi
part1616.0
s reminded Harry of something. If it wa
part1617.0
s Monday -- and you
could usually count
part1618.0
 on Dudley to know the days the week, b
part1619.0
ecause of
television -- then tomorrow, 
part1620.0
Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday.
part1621.0
 Of
course, his birthdays were never ex
part1622.0
actly fun -- last year, the Dursleys
ha
part1623.0
d given him a coat hanger and a pair of
part1624.0
 Uncle Vernon's old socks.
Still, you w
part1625.0
eren't eleven every day.

Uncle Vernon 
part1626.0
was back and he was smiling. He was als
part1627.0
o carrying a long,
thin package and did
part1628.0
n't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked 
part1629.0
what he'd
bought.

"Found the perfect p
part1630.0
lace!" he said. "Come on! Everyone out!
part1631.0
"

It was very cold outside the car. Un
part1632.0
cle Vernon was pointing at what
looked 
part1633.0
like a large rock way out at sea. Perch
part1634.0
ed on top of the rock was
the most mise
part1635.0
rable little shack you could imagine. O
part1636.0
ne thing was
certain, there was no tele
part1637.0
vision in there.

"Storm forecast for t
part1638.0
onight!" said Uncle Vernon gleefully, c
part1639.0
lapping his
hands together. "And this g
part1640.0
entleman's kindly agreed to lend us his
part1641.0

boat!"

A toothless old man came ambli
part1642.0
ng up to them, pointing, with a rather

part1643.0
wicked grin, at an old rowboat bobbing 
part1644.0
in the iron-gray water below
them.

"I'
part1645.0
ve already got us some rations," said U
part1646.0
ncle Vernon, "so all aboard!"

It was f
part1647.0
reezing in the boat. Icy sea spray and 
part1648.0
rain crept down their
necks and a chill
part1649.0
y wind whipped their faces. After what 
part1650.0
seemed like
hours they reached the rock
part1651.0
, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and slid
part1652.0
ing,
led the way to the broken-down hou
part1653.0
se.

The inside was horrible; it smelle
part1654.0
d strongly of seaweed, the wind
whistle
part1655.0
d through the gaps in the wooden walls,
part1656.0
 and the fireplace was
damp and empty. 
part1657.0
There were only two rooms.

Uncle Verno
part1658.0
n's rations turned out to be a bag of c
part1659.0
hips each and four
bananas. He tried to
part1660.0
 start a fire but the empty chip bags j
part1661.0
ust smoked
and shriveled up.

"Could do
part1662.0
 with some of those letters now, eh?" h
part1663.0
e said cheerfully.

He was in a very go
part1664.0
od mood. Obviously he thought nobody st
part1665.0
ood a chance
of reaching them here in a
part1666.0
 storm to deliver mail. Harry privately
part1667.0

agreed, though the thought didn't chee
part1668.0
r him up at all.

As night fell, the pr
part1669.0
omised storm blew up around them. Spray
part1670.0
 from the
high waves splattered the wal
part1671.0
ls of the hut and a fierce wind rattled
part1672.0
 the
filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found
part1673.0
 a few moldy blankets in the second
roo
part1674.0
m and made up a bed for Dudley on the m
part1675.0
oth-eaten sofa. She and Uncle
Vernon we
part1676.0
nt off to the lumpy bed next door, and 
part1677.0
Harry was left to find
the softest bit 
part1678.0
of floor he could and to curl up under 
part1679.0
the thinnest,
most ragged blanket.

The
part1680.0
 storm raged more and more ferociously 
part1681.0
as the night went on. Harry
couldn't sl
part1682.0
eep. He shivered and turned over, tryin
part1683.0
g to get comfortable,
his stomach rumbl
part1684.0
ing with hunger. Dudley's snores were d
part1685.0
rowned by the
low rolls of thunder that
part1686.0
 started near midnight. The lighted dia
part1687.0
l of
Dudley's watch, which was dangling
part1688.0
 over the edge of the sofa on his fat
w
part1689.0
rist, told Harry he'd be eleven in ten 
part1690.0
minutes' time. He lay and
watched his b
part1691.0
irthday tick nearer, wondering if the D
part1692.0
ursleys would
remember at all, wonderin
part1693.0
g where the letter writer was now.

Fiv
part1694.0
e minutes to go. Harry heard something 
part1695.0
creak outside. He hoped the
roof wasn't
part1696.0
 going to fall in, although he might be
part1697.0
 warmer if it did.
Four minutes to go. 
part1698.0
Maybe the house in Privet Drive would b
part1699.0
e so full of
letters when they got back
part1700.0
 that he'd be able to steal one somehow
part1701.0
.

Three minutes to go. Was that the se
part1702.0
a, slapping hard on the rock like
that?
part1703.0
 And (two minutes to go) what was that 
part1704.0
funny crunching noise? Was
the rock cru
part1705.0
mbling into the sea?

One minute to go 
part1706.0
and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds... t
part1707.0
wenty ... ten...
nine -- maybe he'd wak
part1708.0
e Dudley up, just to annoy him -- three
part1709.0
... two...
one...

BOOM.

The whole sha
part1710.0
ck shivered and Harry sat bolt upright,
part1711.0
 staring at the
door. Someone was outsi
part1712.0
de, knocking to come in.


CHAPTER FOUR
part1713.0


THE KEEPER OF THE KEYS

BOOM. They kn
part1714.0
ocked again. Dudley jerked awake. "Wher
part1715.0
e's the cannon?" he
said stupidly.

The
part1716.0
re was a crash behind them and Uncle Ve
part1717.0
rnon came skidding into the
room. He wa
part1718.0
s holding a rifle in his hands -- now t
part1719.0
hey knew what had been
in the long, thi
part1720.0
n package he had brought with them.

"W
part1721.0
ho's there?" he shouted. "I warn you --
part1722.0
 I'm armed!"

There was a pause. Then -
part1723.0
-

SMASH!

The door was hit with such f
part1724.0
orce that it swung clean off its hinges
part1725.0
 and
with a deafening crash landed flat
part1726.0
 on the floor.

A giant of a man was st
part1727.0
anding in the doorway. His face was alm
part1728.0
ost
completely hidden by a long, shaggy
part1729.0
 mane of hair and a wild, tangled
beard
part1730.0
, but you could make out his eyes, glin
part1731.0
ting like black beetles
under all the h
part1732.0
air.

The giant squeezed his way into t
part1733.0
he hut, stooping so that his head just

part1734.0
brushed the ceiling. He bent down, pick
part1735.0
ed up the door, and fitted it
easily ba
part1736.0
ck into its frame. The noise of the sto
part1737.0
rm outside dropped a
little. He turned 
part1738.0
to look at them all.

"Couldn't make us
part1739.0
 a cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been
part1740.0
 an easy
journey..."

He strode over to
part1741.0
 the sofa where Dudley sat frozen with 
part1742.0
fear.

"Budge up, yeh great lump," said
part1743.0
 the stranger.

Dudley squeaked and ran
part1744.0
 to hide behind his mother, who was cro
part1745.0
uching,
terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
part1746.0


"An' here's Harry!" said the giant.


part1747.0
Harry looked up into the fierce, wild, 
part1748.0
shadowy face and saw that the
beetle ey
part1749.0
es were crinkled in a smile.

"Las' tim
part1750.0
e I saw you, you was only a baby," said
part1751.0
 the giant. "Yeh look a
lot like yet da
part1752.0
d, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes."

Unc
part1753.0
le Vernon made a funny rasping noise.


part1754.0
I demand that you leave at once, sit!" 
part1755.0
he said. "You are breaking and
entering
part1756.0
!"

"Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great pr
part1757.0
une," said the giant; he reached over
t
part1758.0
he back of the sofa, jerked the gun out
part1759.0
 of Uncle Vernon's hands, bent
it into 
part1760.0
a knot as easily as if it had been made
part1761.0
 of rubber, and threw it
into a corner 
part1762.0
of the room.

Uncle Vernon made another
part1763.0
 funny noise, like a mouse being trodde
part1764.0
n on.

"Anyway -- Harry," said the gian
part1765.0
t, turning his back on the Dursleys, "a
part1766.0

very happy birthday to yeh. Got summat
part1767.0
 fer yeh here -- I mighta sat on
it at 
part1768.0
some point, but it'll taste all right."
part1769.0


From an inside pocket of his black ov
part1770.0
ercoat he pulled a slightly
squashed bo
part1771.0
x. Harry opened it with trembling finge
part1772.0
rs. Inside was a
large, sticky chocolat
part1773.0
e cake with Happy Birthday Harry writte
part1774.0
n on it in
green icing.

Harry looked u
part1775.0
p at the giant. He meant to say thank y
part1776.0
ou, but the words
got lost on the way t
part1777.0
o his mouth, and what he said instead w
part1778.0
as, "Who are
you?"

The giant chuckled.
part1779.0


"True, I haven't introduced meself. R
part1780.0
ubeus Hagrid, Keeper of Keys and
Ground
part1781.0
s at Hogwarts."

He held out an enormou
part1782.0
s hand and shook Harry's whole arm.

"W
part1783.0
hat about that tea then, eh?" he said, 
part1784.0
rubbing his hands together.
"I'd not sa
part1785.0
y no ter summat stronger if yeh've got 
part1786.0
it, mind."

His eyes fell on the empty 
part1787.0
grate with the shriveled chip bags in i
part1788.0
t and
he snorted. He bent down over the
part1789.0
 fireplace; they couldn't see what he
w
part1790.0
as doing but when he drew back a second
part1791.0
 later, there was a roaring fire
there.
part1792.0
 It filled the whole damp hut with flic
part1793.0
kering light and Harry felt
the warmth 
part1794.0
wash over him as though he'd sunk into 
part1795.0
a hot bath.

The giant sat back down on
part1796.0
 the sofa, which sagged under his weigh
part1797.0
t, and
began taking all sorts of things
part1798.0
 out of the pockets of his coat: a
copp
part1799.0
er kettle, a squashy package of sausage
part1800.0
s, a poker, a teapot, several
chipped m
part1801.0
ugs, and a bottle of some amber liquid 
part1802.0
that he took a swig from
before startin
part1803.0
g to make tea. Soon the hut was full of
part1804.0
 the sound and
smell of sizzling sausag
part1805.0
e. Nobody said a thing while the giant 
part1806.0
was
working, but as he slid the first s
part1807.0
ix fat, juicy, slightly burnt
sausages 
part1808.0
from the poker, Dudley fidgeted a littl
part1809.0
e. Uncle Vernon said
sharply, "Don't to
part1810.0
uch anything he gives you, Dudley."

Th
part1811.0
e giant chuckled darkly.

"Yet great pu
part1812.0
ddin' of a son don' need fattenin' anym
part1813.0
ore, Dursley, don'
worry."

He passed t
part1814.0
he sausages to Harry, who was so hungry
part1815.0
 he had never tasted
anything so wonder
part1816.0
ful, but he still couldn't take his eye
part1817.0
s off the
giant. Finally, as nobody see
part1818.0
med about to explain anything, he said,
part1819.0

"I'm sorry, but I still don't really k
part1820.0
now who you are."

The giant took a gul
part1821.0
p of tea and wiped his mouth with the b
part1822.0
ack of his
hand.

"Call me Hagrid," he 
part1823.0
said, "everyone does. An' like I told y
part1824.0
eh, I'm
Keeper of Keys at Hogwarts -- y
part1825.0
eh'll know all about Hogwarts, o' cours
part1826.0
e.

"Er -- no," said Harry.

Hagrid loo
part1827.0
ked shocked.

"Sorry," Harry said quick
part1828.0
ly.

"Sony?" barked Hagrid, turning to 
part1829.0
stare at the Dursleys, who shrank back

part1830.0
into the shadows. "It' s them as should
part1831.0
 be sorry! I knew yeh weren't
gettin' y
part1832.0
er letters but I never thought yeh woul
part1833.0
dn't even know abou'
Hogwarts, fer cryi
part1834.0
n' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where
part1835.0
 yet parents
learned it all?"

"All wha
part1836.0
t?" asked Harry.

"ALL WHAT?" Hagrid th
part1837.0
undered. "Now wait jus' one second!"

H
part1838.0
e had leapt to his feet. In his anger h
part1839.0
e seemed to fill the whole hut.
The Dur
part1840.0
sleys were cowering against the wall.


part1841.0
"Do you mean ter tell me," he growled a
part1842.0
t the Dursleys, "that this boy --
this 
part1843.0
boy! -- knows nothin' abou' -- about AN
part1844.0
YTHING?"

Harry thought this was going 
part1845.0
a bit far. He had been to school, after
part1846.0

all, and his marks weren't bad.

"I kn
part1847.0
ow some things," he said. "I can, you k
part1848.0
now, do math and stuff." But
Hagrid sim
part1849.0
ply waved his hand and said, "About our
part1850.0
 world, I mean. Your
world. My world. Y
part1851.0
er parents' world."

"What world?"

Hag
part1852.0
rid looked as if he was about to explod
part1853.0
e.

"DURSLEY!" he boomed.

Uncle Vernon
part1854.0
, who had gone very pale, whispered som
part1855.0
ething that sounded
like "Mimblewimble.
part1856.0
" Hagrid stared wildly at Harry.

"But 
part1857.0
yeh must know about yet mom and dad," h
part1858.0
e said. "I mean, they're
famous. You're
part1859.0
 famous."

"What? My -- my mom and dad 
part1860.0
weren't famous, were they?"

"Yeh don' 
part1861.0
know... yeh don' know..." Hagrid ran hi
part1862.0
s fingers through his
hair, fixing Harr
part1863.0
y with a bewildered stare.

"Yeh don' k
part1864.0
now what yeh are?" he said finally.

Un
part1865.0
cle Vernon suddenly found his voice.

"
part1866.0
Stop!" he commanded. "Stop right there,
part1867.0
 sit! I forbid you to tell the
boy anyt
part1868.0
hing!"

A braver man than Vernon Dursle
part1869.0
y would have quailed under the furious

part1870.0
look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid s
part1871.0
poke, his every syllable trembled
with 
part1872.0
rage.

"You never told him? Never told 
part1873.0
him what was in the letter Dumbledore
l
part1874.0
eft fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbled
part1875.0
ore leave it, Dursley! An'
you've kept 
part1876.0
it from him all these years?"

"Kept wh
part1877.0
at from me?" said Harry eagerly.

"STOP
part1878.0
! I FORBID YOU!" yelled Uncle Vernon in
part1879.0
 panic.

Aunt Petunia gave a gasp of ho
part1880.0
rror.

"Ah, go boil yet heads, both of 
part1881.0
yeh," said Hagrid. "Harry -- yet a
wiza
part1882.0
rd."

There was silence inside the hut.
part1883.0
 Only the sea and the whistling wind
co
part1884.0
uld be heard.

"-- a what?" gasped Harr
part1885.0
y.

"A wizard, o' course," said Hagrid,
part1886.0
 sitting back down on the sofa, which
g
part1887.0
roaned and sank even lower, "an' a thum
part1888.0
pin' good'un, I'd say, once
yeh've been
part1889.0
 trained up a bit. With a mum an' dad l
part1890.0
ike yours, what else
would yeh be? An' 
part1891.0
I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer l
part1892.0
etter."

Harry stretched out his hand a
part1893.0
t last to take the yellowish envelope,

part1894.0
addressed in emerald green to Mr. H. Po
part1895.0
tter, The Floor, Hut-on-the-Rock,
The S
part1896.0
ea. He pulled out the letter and read:

Deputy Headmistress

Q
part1910.0
uestions exploded inside Harry's head l
part1911.0
ike fireworks and he couldn't
decide wh
part1912.0
ich to ask first. After a few minutes h
part1913.0
e stammered, "What does
it mean, they a
part1914.0
wait my owl?"

"Gallopin' Gorgons, that
part1915.0
 reminds me," said Hagrid, clapping a h
part1916.0
and to
his forehead with enough force t
part1917.0
o knock over a cart horse, and from yet
part1918.0

another pocket inside his overcoat he 
part1919.0
pulled an owl -- a real, live,
rather r
part1920.0
uffled-looking owl -- a long quill, and
part1921.0
 a roll of parchment.
With his tongue b
part1922.0
etween his teeth he scribbled a note th
part1923.0
at Harry could
read upside down:

Dear 
part1924.0
Professor Dumbledore,

Given Harry his 
part1925.0
letter.

Taking him to buy his things t
part1926.0
omorrow.

Weather's horrible. Hope you'
part1927.0
re Well.

Hagrid

Hagrid rolled up the 
part1928.0
note, gave it to the owl, which clamped
part1929.0
 it in its
beak, went to the door, and 
part1930.0
threw the owl out into the storm. Then 
part1931.0
he
came back and sat down as though thi
part1932.0
s was as normal as talking on the
telep
part1933.0
hone.

Harry realized his mouth was ope
part1934.0
n and closed it quickly.

"Where was I?
part1935.0
" said Hagrid, but at that moment, Uncl
part1936.0
e Vernon, still
ashen-faced but looking
part1937.0
 very angry, moved into the firelight.

part1938.0

"He's not going," he said.

Hagrid gru
part1939.0
nted.

"I'd like ter see a great Muggle
part1940.0
 like you stop him," he said.

"A what?
part1941.0
" said Harry, interested.

"A Muggle," 
part1942.0
said Hagrid, "it's what we call nonmagi
part1943.0
c folk like thern.
An' it's your bad lu
part1944.0
ck you grew up in a family o' the bigge
part1945.0
st Muggles I
ever laid eyes on."

"We s
part1946.0
wore when we took him in we'd put a sto
part1947.0
p to that rubbish," said
Uncle Vernon, 
part1948.0
"swore we'd stamp it out of him! Wizard
part1949.0
 indeed!"

"You knew?" said Harry. "You
part1950.0
 knew I'm a -- a wizard?"

"Knew!" shri
part1951.0
eked Aunt Petunia suddenly. "Knew! Of c
part1952.0
ourse we knew! How
could you not be, my
part1953.0
 dratted sister being what she was? Oh,
part1954.0
 she got a
letter just like that and di
part1955.0
sappeared off to that-that school-and c
part1956.0
ame
home every vacation with her pocket
part1957.0
s full of frog spawn, turning teacups
i
part1958.0
nto rats. I was the only one who saw he
part1959.0
r for what she was -- a freak!
But for 
part1960.0
my mother and father, oh no, it was Lil
part1961.0
y this and Lily that,
they were proud o
part1962.0
f having a witch in the family!"

She s
part1963.0
topped to draw a deep breath and then w
part1964.0
ent ranting on. It seemed
she had been 
part1965.0
wanting to say all this for years.

"Th
part1966.0
en she met that Potter at school and th
part1967.0
ey left and got married and
had you, an
part1968.0
d of course I knew you'd be just the sa
part1969.0
me, just as strange,
just as -- as -- a
part1970.0
bnormal -- and then, if you please, she
part1971.0
 went and got
herself blown up and we g
part1972.0
ot landed with you!"

Harry had gone ve
part1973.0
ry white. As soon as he found his voice
part1974.0
 he said, "Blown
up? You told me they d
part1975.0
ied in a car crash!"

"CAR CRASH!" roar
part1976.0
ed Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that t
part1977.0
he Dursleys
scuttled back to their corn
part1978.0
er. "How could a car crash kill Lily an
part1979.0
'
James Potter? It's an outrage! A scan
part1980.0
dal! Harry Potter not knowin' his
own s
part1981.0
tory when every kid in our world knows 
part1982.0
his name!" "But why? What
happened?" Ha
part1983.0
rry asked urgently.

The anger faded fr
part1984.0
om Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly an
part1985.0
xious.

"I never expected this," he sai
part1986.0
d, in a low, worried voice. "I had no
i
part1987.0
dea, when Dumbledore told me there migh
part1988.0
t be trouble gettin' hold of
yeh, how m
part1989.0
uch yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' 
part1990.0
know if I'm the right
person ter tell y
part1991.0
eh -- but someone 3 s gotta -- yeh can'
part1992.0
t go off ter
Hogwarts not knowin'."

He
part1993.0
 threw a dirty look at the Dursleys.

"
part1994.0
Well, it's best yeh know as much as I c
part1995.0
an tell yeh -- mind, I can't
tell yeh e
part1996.0
verythin', it's a great myst'ry, parts 
part1997.0
of it...."

He sat down, stared into th
part1998.0
e fire for a few seconds, and then said
part1999.0
, "It
begins, I suppose, with -- with a
part2000.0
 person called -- but it's incredible
y
part2001.0
eh don't know his name, everyone in our
part2002.0
 world knows --"

"Who? "

"Well -- I d
part2003.0
on' like sayin' the name if I can help 
part2004.0
it. No one does."

"Why not?"

"Gulpin'
part2005.0
 gargoyles, Harry, people are still sca
part2006.0
red. Blimey, this is
difficult. See, th
part2007.0
ere was this wizard who went... bad. As
part2008.0
 bad as you
could go. Worse. Worse than
part2009.0
 worse. His name was..."

Hagrid gulped
part2010.0
, but no words came out.

"Could you wr
part2011.0
ite it down?" Harry suggested.

"Nah -c
part2012.0
an't spell it. All right -- Voldemort. 
part2013.0
" Hagrid shuddered. "Don'
make me say i
part2014.0
t again. Anyway, this -- this wizard, a
part2015.0
bout twenty years
ago now, started look
part2016.0
in' fer followers. Got 'em, too -- some
part2017.0
 were
afraid, some just wanted a bit o'
part2018.0
 his power, 'cause he was gettin'
himse
part2019.0
lf power, all right. Dark days, Harry. 
part2020.0
Didn't know who ter trust,
didn't dare 
part2021.0
get friendly with strange wizards or wi
part2022.0
tches... terrible
things happened. He w
part2023.0
as takin' over. 'Course, some stood up 
part2024.0
to him --
an' he killed 'em. Horribly. 
part2025.0
One o' the only safe places left was
Ho
part2026.0
gwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's the only on
part2027.0
e You-Know-Who was afraid of.
Didn't da
part2028.0
re try takin' the school, not jus' then
part2029.0
, anyway.

"Now, yer mum an' dad were a
part2030.0
s good a witch an' wizard as I ever kne
part2031.0
w.
Head boy an' girl at Hogwarts in the
part2032.0
ir day! Suppose the myst'ry is why
You-
part2033.0
Know-Who never tried to get 'em on his 
part2034.0
side before... probably knew
they were 
part2035.0
too close ter Dumbledore ter want anyth
part2036.0
in' ter do with the
Dark Side.

"Maybe 
part2037.0
he thought he could persuade 'em... may
part2038.0
be he just wanted 'em
outta the way. Al
part2039.0
l anyone knows is, he turned up in the 
part2040.0
village where
you was all living, on Ha
part2041.0
lloween ten years ago. You was just a y
part2042.0
ear old.
He came ter yer house an' -- a
part2043.0
n' --"

Hagrid suddenly pulled out a ve
part2044.0
ry dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew
part2045.0

his nose with a sound like a foghorn.

part2046.0

"Sorry," he said. "But it's that sad -
part2047.0
- knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer
peopl
part2048.0
e yeh couldn't find -- anyway..."

"You
part2049.0
-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then -- an' t
part2050.0
his is the real myst'ry of
the thing --
part2051.0
 he tried to kill you, too. Wanted ter 
part2052.0
make a clean job of
it, I suppose, or m
part2053.0
aybe he just liked killin' by then. But
part2054.0
 he couldn't
do it. Never wondered how 
part2055.0
you got that mark on yer forehead? That
part2056.0
 was no
ordinary cut. That's what yeh g
part2057.0
et when a Powerful, evil curse touches

part2058.0
yeh -- took care of yer mum an' dad an'
part2059.0
 yer house, even -- but it didn't
work 
part2060.0
on you, an' that's why yer famous, Harr
part2061.0
y. No one ever lived after
he decided t
part2062.0
er kill 'em, no one except you, an' he'
part2063.0
d killed some o' the
best witches an' w
part2064.0
izards of the age -- the McKinnons, the
part2065.0
 Bones, the
Prewetts -- an' you was onl
part2066.0
y a baby, an' you lived."

Something ve
part2067.0
ry painful was going on in Harry's mind
part2068.0
. As Hagrid's story
came to a close, he
part2069.0
 saw again the blinding flash of green 
part2070.0
light, more
clearly than he had ever re
part2071.0
membered it before -- and he remembered
part2072.0

something else, for the first time in 
part2073.0
his life: a high, cold, cruel
laugh.

H
part2074.0
agrid was watching him sadly.

"Took ye
part2075.0
h from the ruined house myself, on Dumb
part2076.0
ledore's orders. Brought
yeh ter this l
part2077.0
ot..."

"Load of old tosh," said Uncle 
part2078.0
Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost
for
part2079.0
gotten that the Dursleys were there. Un
part2080.0
cle Vernon certainly seemed to
have got
part2081.0
 back his courage. He was glaring at Ha
part2082.0
grid and his fists were
clenched.

"Now
part2083.0
, you listen here, boy," he snarled, "I
part2084.0
 accept there's something
strange about
part2085.0
 you, probably nothing a good beating w
part2086.0
ouldn't have cured
-- and as for all th
part2087.0
is about your parents, well, they were 
part2088.0
weirdos, no
denying it, and the world's
part2089.0
 better off without them in my opinion 
part2090.0
--
asked for all they got, getting mixe
part2091.0
d up with these wizarding types --
just
part2092.0
 what I expected, always knew they'd co
part2093.0
me to a sticky end --"

But at that mom
part2094.0
ent, Hagrid leapt from the sofa and dre
part2095.0
w a battered pink
umbrella from inside 
part2096.0
his coat. Pointing this at Uncle Vernon
part2097.0
 like a
sword, he said, "I'm warning yo
part2098.0
u, Dursley -I'm warning you -- one more
part2099.0

word... "

In danger of being speared 
part2100.0
on the end of an umbrella by a bearded 
part2101.0
giant,
Uncle Vernon's courage failed ag
part2102.0
ain; he flattened himself against the
w
part2103.0
all and fell silent.

"That's better," 
part2104.0
said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitt
part2105.0
ing back down on
the sofa, which this t
part2106.0
ime sagged right down to the floor.

Ha
part2107.0
rry, meanwhile, still had questions to 
part2108.0
ask, hundreds of them.

"But what happe
part2109.0
ned to Vol--, sorry -- I mean, You-Know
part2110.0
-Who?"

"Good question, Harry. Disappea
part2111.0
red. Vanished. Same night he tried ter

part2112.0
kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. T
part2113.0
hat's the biggest myst'ry, see...
he wa
part2114.0
s gettin' more an' more powerful -- why
part2115.0
'd he go?

"Some say he died. Codswallo
part2116.0
p, in my opinion. Dunno if he had enoug
part2117.0
h
human left in him to die. Some say he
part2118.0
's still out there, bidin' his
time, li
part2119.0
ke, but I don' believe it. People who w
part2120.0
as on his side came back
ter ours. Some
part2121.0
 of 'em came outta kinda trances. Don~ 
part2122.0
reckon they
could've done if he was com
part2123.0
in' back.

"Most of us reckon he's stil
part2124.0
l out there somewhere but lost his powe
part2125.0
rs.
Too weak to carry on. 'Cause someth
part2126.0
in' about you finished him, Harry.
Ther
part2127.0
e was somethin' goin' on that night he 
part2128.0
hadn't counted on -- I dunno
what it wa
part2129.0
s, no one does -- but somethin' about y
part2130.0
ou stumped him, all
right."

Hagrid loo
part2131.0
ked at Harry with warmth and respect bl
part2132.0
azing in his eyes, but
Harry, instead o
part2133.0
f feeling pleased and proud, felt quite
part2134.0
 sure there had
been a horrible mistake
part2135.0
. A wizard? Him? How could he possibly 
part2136.0
be? He'd
spent his life being clouted b
part2137.0
y Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia a
part2138.0
nd
Uncle Vernon; if he was really a wiz
part2139.0
ard, why hadn't they been turned
into w
part2140.0
arty toads every time they'd tried to l
part2141.0
ock him in his cupboard? If
he'd once d
part2142.0
efeated the greatest sorcerer in the wo
part2143.0
rld, how come Dudley
had always been ab
part2144.0
le to kick him around like a football?

part2145.0

"Hagrid," he said quietly, "I think yo
part2146.0
u must have made a mistake. I
don't thi
part2147.0
nk I can be a wizard."

To his surprise
part2148.0
, Hagrid chuckled.

"Not a wizard, eh? 
part2149.0
Never made things happen when you was s
part2150.0
cared or
angry?"

Harry looked into the
part2151.0
 fire. Now he came to think about it...
part2152.0
 every odd
thing that had ever made his
part2153.0
 aunt and uncle furious with him had
ha
part2154.0
ppened when he, Harry, had been upset o
part2155.0
r angry... chased by Dudley's
gang, he 
part2156.0
had somehow found himself out of their 
part2157.0
reach... dreading going
to school with 
part2158.0
that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed t
part2159.0
o make it grow
back... and the very las
part2160.0
t time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he go
part2161.0
t his
revenge, without even realizing h
part2162.0
e was doing it? Hadn't he set a boa
con
part2163.0
strictor on him?

Harry looked back at 
part2164.0
Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid wa
part2165.0
s positively
beaming at him.

"See?" sa
part2166.0
id Hagrid. "Harry Potter, not a wizard 
part2167.0
-- you wait, you'll be
right famous at 
part2168.0
Hogwarts."

But Uncle Vernon wasn't goi
part2169.0
ng to give in without a fight.

"Haven'
part2170.0
t I told you he's not going?" he hissed
part2171.0
. "He's going to Stonewall
High and he'
part2172.0
ll be grateful for it. I've read those 
part2173.0
letters and he needs
all sorts of rubbi
part2174.0
sh -- spell books and wands and --"

"I
part2175.0
f he wants ter go, a great Muggle like 
part2176.0
you won't stop him," growled
Hagrid. "S
part2177.0
top Lily an' James Potter' s son goin' 
part2178.0
ter Hogwarts! Yer mad.
His name's been 
part2179.0
down ever since he was born. He's off t
part2180.0
er the finest
school of witchcraft and 
part2181.0
wizardry in the world. Seven years ther
part2182.0
e and he
won't know himself. He'll be w
part2183.0
ith youngsters of his own sort, fer a
c
part2184.0
hange, an' he'll be under the greatest 
part2185.0
headmaster Hogwarts ever had
Albus Dumb
part2186.0
led--"

"I AM NOT PAYING FOR SOME CRACK
part2187.0
POT OLD FOOL To TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!
part2188.0
"
yelled Uncle Vernon.

But he had fina
part2189.0
lly gone too far. Hagrid seized his umb
part2190.0
rella and whirled
it over his head, "NE
part2191.0
VER," he thundered, "- INSULT- ALBUS- D
part2192.0
UMBLEDORE-
IN- FRONT- OF- ME!"

He brou
part2193.0
ght the umbrella swishing down through 
part2194.0
the air to point at Dudley
-- there was
part2195.0
 a flash of violet light, a sound like 
part2196.0
a firecracker, a
sharp squeal, and the 
part2197.0
next second, Dudley was dancing on the 
part2198.0
spot with
his hands clasped over his fa
part2199.0
t bottom, howling in pain. When he turn
part2200.0
ed
his back on them, Harry saw a curly 
part2201.0
pig's tail poking through a hole in
his
part2202.0
 trousers.

Uncle Vernon roared. Pullin
part2203.0
g Aunt Petunia and Dudley into the othe
part2204.0
r
room, he cast one last terrified look
part2205.0
 at Hagrid and slammed the door
behind 
part2206.0
them.

Hagrid looked down at his umbrel
part2207.0
la and stroked his beard.

"Shouldn'ta 
part2208.0
lost me temper," he said ruefully, "but
part2209.0
 it didn't work
anyway. Meant ter turn 
part2210.0
him into a pig, but I suppose he was so
part2211.0
 much like
a pig anyway there wasn't mu
part2212.0
ch left ter do."

He cast a sideways lo
part2213.0
ok at Harry under his bushy eyebrows.


part2214.0
"Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that
part2215.0
 ter anyone at Hogwarts," he
said. "I'm
part2216.0
 -- er -- not supposed ter do magic, st
part2217.0
rictly speakin'. I was
allowed ter do a
part2218.0
 bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters
part2219.0
 to yeh an' stuff
-- one o' the reasons
part2220.0
 I was so keen ter take on the job

"Wh
part2221.0
y aren't you supposed to do magic?" ask
part2222.0
ed Harry.

"Oh, well -- I was at Hogwar
part2223.0
ts meself but I -- er -- got expelled, 
part2224.0
ter
tell yeh the truth. In me third yea
part2225.0
r. They snapped me wand in half an'
eve
part2226.0
rything. But Dumbledore let me stay on 
part2227.0
as gamekeeper. Great man,
Dumbledore." 
part2228.0
"Why were you expelled?"

"It's gettin'
part2229.0
 late and we've got lots ter do tomorro
part2230.0
w," said Hagrid
loudly. "Gotta get up t
part2231.0
er town, get all yer books an' that."


part2232.0
He took off his thick black coat and th
part2233.0
rew it to Harry.

"You can kip under th
part2234.0
at," he said. "Don' mind if it wriggles
part2235.0
 a bit, I
think I still got a couple o'

DIAGON ALLEY

Harry woke earl
part2238.0
y the next morning. Although he could t
part2239.0
ell it was
daylight, he kept his eyes s
part2240.0
hut tight.

"It was a dream, he told hi
part2241.0
mself firmly. "I dreamed a giant called
part2242.0

Hagrid came to tell me I was going to 
part2243.0
a school for wizards. When I open
my ey
part2244.0
es I'll be at home in my cupboard."

Th
part2245.0
ere was suddenly a loud tapping noise.

part2246.0

And there's Aunt Petunia knocking on t
part2247.0
he door, Harry thought, his heart
sinki
part2248.0
ng. But he still didn't open his eyes. 
part2249.0
It had been such a good
dream.

Tap. Ta
part2250.0
p. Tap.

"All right," Harry mumbled, "I
part2251.0
'm getting up."

He sat up and Hagrid's
part2252.0
 heavy coat fell off him. The hut was f
part2253.0
ull of
sunlight, the storm was over, Ha
part2254.0
grid himself was asleep on the collapse
part2255.0
d
sofa, and there was an owl rapping it
part2256.0
s claw on the window, a newspaper
held 
part2257.0
in its beak.

Harry scrambled to his fe
part2258.0
et, so happy he felt as though a large 
part2259.0
balloon
was swelling inside him. He wen
part2260.0
t straight to the window and jerked it

part2261.0
open. The owl swooped in and dropped th
part2262.0
e newspaper on top of Hagrid, who
didn'
part2263.0
t wake up. The owl then fluttered onto 
part2264.0
the floor and began to
attack Hagrid's 
part2265.0
coat.

"Don't do that."

Harry tried to
part2266.0
 wave the owl out of the way, but it sn
part2267.0
apped its beak
fiercely at him and carr
part2268.0
ied on savaging the coat.

"Hagrid!" sa
part2269.0
id Harry loudly. "There's an owl

"Pay 
part2270.0
him," Hagrid grunted into the sofa.

"W
part2271.0
hat?"

"He wants payin' fer deliverin' 
part2272.0
the paper. Look in the pockets."
Hagrid
part2273.0
's coat seemed to be made of nothing bu
part2274.0
t pockets -- bunches of
keys, slug pell
part2275.0
ets, balls of string, peppermint humbug
part2276.0
s, teabags...
finally, Harry pulled out
part2277.0
 a handful of strange-looking coins.

"
part2278.0
Give him five Knuts," said Hagrid sleep
part2279.0
ily.

"Knuts?"

"The little bronze ones
part2280.0
."

Harry counted out five little bronz
part2281.0
e coins, and the owl held out his leg
s
part2282.0
o Harry could put the money into a smal
part2283.0
l leather pouch tied to it. Then
he fle
part2284.0
w off through the open window.

Hagrid 
part2285.0
yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.


part2286.0
"Best be Off, Harry, lots ter do today,
part2287.0
 gotta get up ter London an' buy
all ye
part2288.0
r stuff fer school."

Harry was turning
part2289.0
 over the wizard coins and looking at t
part2290.0
hem. He had just
thought of something t
part2291.0
hat made him feel as though the happy b
part2292.0
alloon
inside him had got a puncture.


part2293.0
"Um -- Hagrid?"

"Mm?" said Hagrid, who
part2294.0
 was pulling on his huge boots.

"I hav
part2295.0
en't got any money -- and you heard Unc
part2296.0
le Vernon last night ... he
won't pay f
part2297.0
or me to go and learn magic."

"Don't w
part2298.0
orry about that," said Hagrid, standing
part2299.0
 up and scratching his
head. "D'yeh thi
part2300.0
nk yer parents didn't leave yeh anythin
part2301.0
g?"

"But if their house was destroyed 
part2302.0
--"

"They didn' keep their gold in the
part2303.0
 house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is

part2304.0
Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have a sausag
part2305.0
e, they're not bad cold -- an' I
wouldn
part2306.0
' say no teh a bit o' yer birthday cake
part2307.0
, neither."

"Wizards have banks?"

"Ju
part2308.0
st the one. Gringotts. Run by goblins."
part2309.0


Harry dropped the bit of sausage he w
part2310.0
as holding.

"Goblins?"

"Yeah -- so ye
part2311.0
h'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tel
part2312.0
l yeh that. Never
mess with goblins, Ha
part2313.0
rry. Gringotts is the safest place in t
part2314.0
he world fer
anything yeh want ter keep
part2315.0
 safe -- 'cept maybe Hogwarts. As a mat
part2316.0
ter o'
fact, I gotta visit Gringotts an
part2317.0
yway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts
business
part2318.0
." Hagrid drew himself up proudly. "He 
part2319.0
usually gets me ter do
important stuff 
part2320.0
fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things fr
part2321.0
om Gringotts --
knows he can trust me, 
part2322.0
see.

"Got everythin'? Come on, then."

part2323.0

Harry followed Hagrid out onto the roc
part2324.0
k. The sky was quite clear now and
the 
part2325.0
sea gleamed in the sunlight. The boat U
part2326.0
ncle Vernon had hired was
still there, 
part2327.0
with a lot of water in the bottom after
part2328.0
 the storm.

"How did you get here?" Ha
part2329.0
rry asked, looking around for another b
part2330.0
oat.
"Flew," said Hagrid.

"Flew?"

"Ye
part2331.0
ah -- but we'll go back in this. Not s'
part2332.0
pposed ter use magic now I've
got yeh."
part2333.0


They settled down in the boat, Harry 
part2334.0
still staring at Hagrid, trying to
imag
part2335.0
ine him flying.

"Seems a shame ter row
part2336.0
, though," said Hagrid, giving Harry an
part2337.0
other of
his sideways looks. "If I was 
part2338.0
ter -- er -- speed things up a bit, wou
part2339.0
ld
yeh mind not mentionin' it at Hogwar
part2340.0
ts?"

"Of course not," said Harry, eage
part2341.0
r to see more magic. Hagrid pulled out

part2342.0
the pink umbrella again, tapped it twic
part2343.0
e on the side of the boat, and
they spe
part2344.0
d off toward land.

"Why would you be m
part2345.0
ad to try and rob Gringotts?" Harry ask
part2346.0
ed.

"Spells -- enchantments," said Hag
part2347.0
rid, unfolding his newspaper as he
spok
part2348.0
e. "They say there's dragons guardin' t
part2349.0
he highsecurity vaults. And
then yeh go
part2350.0
tta find yer way -- Gringotts is hundre
part2351.0
ds of miles under
London, see. Deep und
part2352.0
er the Underground. Yeh'd die of hunger
part2353.0
 tryin' ter
get out, even if yeh did ma
part2354.0
nage ter get yer hands on summat."

Har
part2355.0
ry sat and thought about this while Hag
part2356.0
rid read his newspaper, the
Daily Proph
part2357.0
et. Harry had learned from Uncle Vernon
part2358.0
 that people liked to
be left alone whi
part2359.0
le they did this, but it was very diffi
part2360.0
cult, he'd never
had so many questions 
part2361.0
in his life.

"Ministry o' Magic messin
part2362.0
' things up as usual," Hagrid muttered,
part2363.0
 turning
the page.

"There's a Ministry
part2364.0
 of Magic?" Harry asked, before he coul
part2365.0
d stop
himself.

"'Course," said Hagrid
part2366.0
. "They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister,
part2367.0
 0 '
course, but he'd never leave Hogwa
part2368.0
rts, so old Cornelius Fudge got the
job
part2369.0
. Bungler if ever there was one. So he 
part2370.0
pelts Dumbledore with owls
every mornin
part2371.0
g, askin' fer advice."

"But what does 
part2372.0
a Ministry of Magic do?"

"Well, their 
part2373.0
main job is to keep it from the Muggles
part2374.0
 that there's still
witches an' wizards
part2375.0
 up an' down the country."

"Why?"

"Wh
part2376.0
y? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin'
part2377.0
 magic solutions to their
problems. Nah
part2378.0
, we're best left alone."

At this mome
part2379.0
nt the boat bumped gently into the harb
part2380.0
or wall. Hagrid
folded up his newspaper
part2381.0
, and they clambered up the stone steps
part2382.0
 onto the
street.

Passersby stared a l
part2383.0
ot at Hagrid as they walked through the
part2384.0
 little town
to the station. Harry coul
part2385.0
dn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid tw
part2386.0
ice as
tall as anyone else, he kept poi
part2387.0
nting at perfectly ordinary things like
part2388.0

parking meters and saying loudly, "See
part2389.0
 that, Harry? Things these Muggles
drea
part2390.0
m up, eh?"

"Hagrid," said Harry, panti
part2391.0
ng a bit as he ran to keep up, "did you
part2392.0
 say
there are dragons at Gringotts?"


part2393.0
"Well, so they say," said Hagrid. "Crik
part2394.0
ey, I'd like a dragon."

"You'd like on
part2395.0
e?"

"Wanted one ever since I was a kid
part2396.0
 -- here we go."

They had reached the 
part2397.0
station. There was a train to London in
part2398.0
 five
minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't
part2399.0
 understand "Muggle money," as he
calle
part2400.0
d it, gave the bills to Harry so he cou
part2401.0
ld buy their tickets.

People stared mo
part2402.0
re than ever on the train. Hagrid took 
part2403.0
up two seats and
sat knitting what look
part2404.0
ed like a canary-yellow circus tent.

"
part2405.0
Still got yer letter, Harry?" he asked 
part2406.0
as he counted stitches. Harry
took the 
part2407.0
parchment envelope out of his pocket.


part2408.0
"Good," said Hagrid. "There's a list th
part2409.0
ere of everything yeh need."

Harry unf
part2410.0
olded a second piece of paper he hadn't
part2411.0
 noticed the night
before, and read:

"Can we buy a
part2440.0
ll this in London?" Harry wondered alou
part2441.0
d.

"If yeh know where to go," said Hag
part2442.0
rid.

Harry had never been to London be
part2443.0
fore. Although Hagrid seemed to know
wh
part2444.0
ere he was going, he was obviously not 
part2445.0
used to getting there in an
ordinary wa
part2446.0
y. He got stuck in the ticket barrier o
part2447.0
n the Underground, and
complained loudl
part2448.0
y that the seats were too small and the
part2449.0
 trains too slow.

"I don't know how th
part2450.0
e Muggles manage without magic," he sai
part2451.0
d as they
climbed a broken-down escalat
part2452.0
or that led up to a bustling road lined
part2453.0

with shops.

Hagrid was so huge that h
part2454.0
e parted the crowd easily; all Harry ha
part2455.0
d to do
was keep close behind him. They
part2456.0
 passed book shops and music stores,
ha
part2457.0
mburger restaurants and cinemas, but no
part2458.0
where that looked as if it
could sell y
part2459.0
ou a magic wand. This was just an ordin
part2460.0
ary street full of
ordinary people. Cou
part2461.0
ld there really be piles of wizard gold
part2462.0
 buried miles
beneath them? Were there 
part2463.0
really shops that sold spell books and

part2464.0
broomsticks? Might this not all be some
part2465.0
 huge joke that the Dursleys had
cooked
part2466.0
 up? If Harry hadn't known that the Dur
part2467.0
sleys had no sense of
humor, he might h
part2468.0
ave thought so; yet somehow, even thoug
part2469.0
h everything
Hagrid had told him so far
part2470.0
 was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help

part2471.0
trusting him.

"This is it," said Hagri
part2472.0
d, coming to a halt, "the Leaky Cauldro
part2473.0
n. It's a
famous place."

It was a tiny
part2474.0
, grubby-looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't 
part2475.0
pointed it out,
Harry wouldn't have not
part2476.0
iced it was there. The people hurrying 
part2477.0
by didn't
glance at it. Their eyes slid
part2478.0
 from the big book shop on one side to 
part2479.0
the
record shop on the other as if they
part2480.0
 couldn't see the Leaky Cauldron at
all
part2481.0
. In fact, Harry had the most peculiar 
part2482.0
feeling that only he and
Hagrid could s
part2483.0
ee it. Before he could mention this, Ha
part2484.0
grid had steered
him inside.

For a fam
part2485.0
ous place, it was very dark and shabby.
part2486.0
 A few old women were
sitting in a corn
part2487.0
er, drinking tiny glasses of sherry. On
part2488.0
e of them was
smoking a long pipe. A li
part2489.0
ttle man in a top hat was talking to th
part2490.0
e old
bartender, who was quite bald and
part2491.0
 looked like a toothless walnut. The
lo
part2492.0
w buzz of chatter stopped when they wal
part2493.0
ked in. Everyone seemed to know
Hagrid;
part2494.0
 they waved and smiled at him, and the 
part2495.0
bartender reached for a
glass, saying, 
part2496.0
"The usual, Hagrid?"

"Can't, Tom, I'm 
part2497.0
on Hogwarts business," said Hagrid, cla
part2498.0
pping his great
hand on Harry's shoulde
part2499.0
r and making Harry's knees buckle.


"G
part2500.0
ood Lord," said the bartender, peering 
part2501.0
at Harry, "is this -- can this
be --?"

part2502.0


The Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone 
part2503.0
completely still and silent.

"Bless my
part2504.0
 soul," whispered the old bartender, "H
part2505.0
arry Potter... what an
honor."

He hurr
part2506.0
ied out from behind the bar, rushed tow
part2507.0
ard Harry and seized his
hand, tears in
part2508.0
 his eyes.

"Welcome back, Mr. Potter, 
part2509.0
welcome back."

Harry didn't know what 
part2510.0
to say. Everyone was looking at him. Th
part2511.0
e old
woman with the pipe was puffing o
part2512.0
n it without realizing it had gone out.
part2513.0

Hagrid was beaming.

Then there was a 
part2514.0
great scraping of chairs and the next m
part2515.0
oment, Harry
found himself shaking hand
part2516.0
s with everyone in the Leaky Cauldron.

part2517.0

"Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't be
part2518.0
lieve I'm meeting you at last."

"So pr
part2519.0
oud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud."

"
part2520.0
Always wanted to shake your hand -- I'm
part2521.0
 all of a flutter."

"Delighted, Mr. Po
part2522.0
tter, just can't tell you, Diggle's the
part2523.0
 name, Dedalus
Diggle."

"I've seen you
part2524.0
 before!" said Harry, as Dedalus Diggle
part2525.0
's top hat fell off
in his excitement. 
part2526.0
"You bowed to me once in a shop."

"He 
part2527.0
remembers!" cried Dedalus Diggle, looki
part2528.0
ng around at everyone. "Did
you hear th
part2529.0
at? He remembers me!" Harry shook hands
part2530.0
 again and again --
Doris Crockford kep
part2531.0
t coming back for more.

A pale young m
part2532.0
an made his way forward, very nervously
part2533.0
. One of his eyes
was twitching.

"Prof
part2534.0
essor Quirrell!" said Hagrid. "Harry, P
part2535.0
rofessor Quirrell will be
one of your t
part2536.0
eachers at Hogwarts."

"P-P-Potter," st
part2537.0
ammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Ha
part2538.0
rry's hand,
"c-can't t-tell you how p- 
part2539.0
pleased I am to meet you."

"What sort 
part2540.0
of magic do you teach, Professor Quirre
part2541.0
ll?"

"D-Defense Against the D-D-Dark A
part2542.0
rts," muttered Professor Quirrell, as
t
part2543.0
hough he'd rather not think about it. "
part2544.0
N-not that you n-need it, eh,
P-P-Potte
part2545.0
r?" He laughed nervously. "You'll be g-
part2546.0
getting all your
equipment, I suppose? 
part2547.0
I've g-got to p-pick up a new b-book on
part2548.0
 vampires,
m-myself." He looked terrifi
part2549.0
ed at the very thought.

But the others
part2550.0
 wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep H
part2551.0
arry to himself. It
took almost ten min
part2552.0
utes to get away from them all. At last
part2553.0
, Hagrid
managed to make himself heard 
part2554.0
over the babble.

"Must get on -- lots 
part2555.0
ter buy. Come on, Harry."

Doris Crockf
part2556.0
ord shook Harry's hand one last time, a
part2557.0
nd Hagrid led them
through the bar and 
part2558.0
out into a small, walled courtyard, whe
part2559.0
re there was
nothing but a trash can an
part2560.0
d a few weeds.

Hagrid grinned at Harry
part2561.0
.

"Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you wa
part2562.0
s famous. Even Professor Quirrell
was t
part2563.0
remblin' ter meet yeh -- mind you, he's
part2564.0
 usually tremblin'."

"Is he always tha
part2565.0
t nervous?"

"Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Bri
part2566.0
lliant mind. He was fine while he was


part2567.0
studyin' outta books but then he took a
part2568.0
 year off ter get some firsthand
experi
part2569.0
ence.... They say he met vampires in th
part2570.0
e Black Forest, and there
was a nasty b
part2571.0
it o' trouble with a hag -- never been 
part2572.0
the same since.
Scared of the students,
part2573.0
 scared of his own subject now, where's
part2574.0
 me
umbrella?"

Vampires? Hags? Harry's
part2575.0
 head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, 
part2576.0
was
counting bricks in the wall above t
part2577.0
he trash can.

"Three up... two across 
part2578.0
he muttered. "Right, stand back, Harry.
part2579.0
"

He tapped the wall three times with 
part2580.0
the point of his umbrella.

The brick h
part2581.0
e had touched quivered -- it wriggled -
part2582.0
- in the middle, a
small hole appeared 
part2583.0
-- it grew wider and wider -- a second 
part2584.0
later they
were facing an archway large
part2585.0
 enough even for Hagrid, an archway ont
part2586.0
o a
cobbled street that twisted and tur
part2587.0
ned out of sight.

"Welcome," said Hagr
part2588.0
id, "to Diagon Alley."

He grinned at H
part2589.0
arry's amazement. They stepped through 
part2590.0
the archway. Harry
looked quickly over 
part2591.0
his shoulder and saw the archway shrink
part2592.0
 instantly
back into solid wall.

The s
part2593.0
un shone brightly on a stack of cauldro
part2594.0
ns outside the nearest shop.
Cauldrons 
part2595.0
-- All Sizes - Copper, Brass, Pewter, S
part2596.0
ilver -- Self-Stirring

part2597.0
said a sign hanging over them.

"Yeah, 
part2598.0
you'll be needin' one," said Hagrid, "b
part2599.0
ut we gotta get yer money
first."

Harr
part2600.0
y wished he had about eight more eyes. 
part2601.0
He turned his head in every
direction a
part2602.0
s they walked up the street, trying to 
part2603.0
look at everything at
once: the shops, 
part2604.0
the things outside them, the people doi
part2605.0
ng their
shopping. A plump woman outsid
part2606.0
e an Apothecary was shaking her head as
part2607.0

they passed, saying, "Dragon liver, se
part2608.0
venteen Sickles an ounce, they're
mad..
part2609.0
.."

A low, soft hooting came from a da
part2610.0
rk shop with a sign saying Eeylops Owl

part2611.0
Emporium -- Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown
part2612.0
, and Snowy. Several boys of
about Harr
part2613.0
y's age had their noses pressed against
part2614.0
 a window with
broomsticks in it. "Look
part2615.0
," Harry heard one of them say, "the ne
part2616.0
w Nimbus
Two Thousand -- fastest ever -
part2617.0
-" There were shops selling robes, shop
part2618.0
s
selling telescopes and strange silver
part2619.0
 instruments Harry had never seen
befor
part2620.0
e, windows stacked with barrels of bat 
part2621.0
spleens and eels' eyes,
tottering piles
part2622.0
 of spell books, quills, and rolls of p
part2623.0
archment, potion
bottles, globes of the
part2624.0
 moon....

"Gringotts," said Hagrid.

T
part2625.0
hey had reached a snowy white building 
part2626.0
that towered over the other
little shop
part2627.0
s. Standing beside its burnished bronze
part2628.0
 doors, wearing a
uniform of scarlet an
part2629.0
d gold, was -

"Yeah, that's a goblin,"
part2630.0
 said Hagrid quietly as they walked up 
part2631.0
the white
stone steps toward him. The g
part2632.0
oblin was about a head shorter than Har
part2633.0
ry.
He had a swarthy, clever face, a po
part2634.0
inted beard and, Harry noticed, very
lo
part2635.0
ng fingers and feet. He bowed as they w
part2636.0
alked inside. Now they were
facing a se
part2637.0
cond pair of doors, silver this time, w
part2638.0
ith words engraved
upon them:

Enter, s
part2639.0
tranger, but take heed

Of what awaits 
part2640.0
the sin of greed,

For those who take, 
part2641.0
but do not earn,

Must pay most dearly 
part2642.0
in their turn.

So if you seek beneath 
part2643.0
our floors

A treasure that was never y
part2644.0
ours,

Thief, you have been warned, bew
part2645.0
are

Of finding more than treasure ther
part2646.0
e.

"Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try 
part2647.0
an' rob it," said Hagrid.

A pair of go
part2648.0
blins bowed them through the silver doo
part2649.0
rs and they were in a
vast marble hall.
part2650.0
 About a hundred more goblins were sitt
part2651.0
ing on high
stools behind a long counte
part2652.0
r, scribbling in large ledgers, weighin
part2653.0
g
coins in brass scales, examining prec
part2654.0
ious stones through eyeglasses.
There w
part2655.0
ere too many doors to count leading off
part2656.0
 the hall, and yet more
goblins were sh
part2657.0
owing people in and out of these. Hagri
part2658.0
d and Harry made
for the counter.

"Mor
part2659.0
ning," said Hagrid to a free goblin. "W
part2660.0
e've come ter take some money
outta Mr.
part2661.0
 Harry Potter's safe."

"You have his k
part2662.0
ey, Sir?"

"Got it here somewhere," sai
part2663.0
d Hagrid, and he started emptying his
p
part2664.0
ockets onto the counter, scattering a h
part2665.0
andful of moldy dog biscuits
over the g
part2666.0
oblin's book of numbers. The goblin wri
part2667.0
nkled his nose. Harry
watched the gobli
part2668.0
n on their right weighing a pile of rub
part2669.0
ies as big as
glowing coals.

"Got it,"
part2670.0
 said Hagrid at last, holding up a tiny
part2671.0
 golden key.

The goblin looked at it c
part2672.0
losely.

"That seems to be in order."


part2673.0
"An' I've also got a letter here from P
part2674.0
rofessor Dumbledore," said Hagrid
impor
part2675.0
tantly, throwing out his chest. "It's a
part2676.0
bout the YouKnow-What in
vault seven hu
part2677.0
ndred and thirteen."

The goblin read t
part2678.0
he letter carefully.

"Very well," he s
part2679.0
aid, handing it back to Hagrid, "I will
part2680.0
 have Someone
take you down to both vau
part2681.0
lts. Griphook!"

Griphook was yet anoth
part2682.0
er goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all 
part2683.0
the dog
biscuits back inside his pocket
part2684.0
s, he and Harry followed Griphook towar
part2685.0
d
one of the doors leading off the hall
part2686.0
.

"What's the You-Know-What in vault s
part2687.0
even hundred and thirteen?" Harry
asked
part2688.0
.

"Can't tell yeh that," said Hagrid m
part2689.0
ysteriously. "Very secret. Hogwarts
bus
part2690.0
iness. Dumbledore's trusted me. More'n 
part2691.0
my job's worth ter tell yeh
that."

Gri
part2692.0
phook held the door open for them. Harr
part2693.0
y, who had expected more
marble, was su
part2694.0
rprised. They were in a narrow stone pa
part2695.0
ssageway lit with
flaming torches. It s
part2696.0
loped steeply downward and there were l
part2697.0
ittle
railway tracks on the floor. Grip
part2698.0
hook whistled and a small cart came
hur
part2699.0
tling up the tracks toward them. They c
part2700.0
limbed in -- Hagrid with some
difficult
part2701.0
y -- and were off.

At first they just 
part2702.0
hurtled through a maze of twisting pass
part2703.0
ages. Harry
tried to remember, left, ri
part2704.0
ght, right, left, middle fork, right, l
part2705.0
eft,
but it was impossible. The rattlin
part2706.0
g cart seemed to know its own way,
beca
part2707.0
use Griphook wasn't steering.

Harry's 
part2708.0
eyes stung as the cold air rushed past 
part2709.0
them, but he kept them
wide open. Once,
part2710.0
 he thought he saw a burst of fire at t
part2711.0
he end of a
passage and twisted around 
part2712.0
to see if it was a dragon, but too late
part2713.0
 - -
they plunged even deeper, passing 
part2714.0
an underground lake where huge
stalacti
part2715.0
tes and stalagmites grew from the ceili
part2716.0
ng and floor.

I never know," Harry cal
part2717.0
led to Hagrid over the noise of the car
part2718.0
t,
"what's the difference between a sta
part2719.0
lagmite and a stalactite?"

"Stalagmite
part2720.0
's got an 'm' in it," said Hagrid. "An'
part2721.0
 don' ask me questions
just now, I thin
part2722.0
k I'm gonna be sick."

He did look very
part2723.0
 green, and when the cart stopped at la
part2724.0
st beside a small
door in the passage w
part2725.0
all, Hagrid got out and had to lean aga
part2726.0
inst the
wall to stop his knees from tr
part2727.0
embling.

Griphook unlocked the door. A
part2728.0
 lot of green smoke came billowing out,
part2729.0
 and
as it cleared, Harry gasped. Insid
part2730.0
e were mounds of gold coins. Columns
of
part2731.0
 silver. Heaps of little bronze Knuts.

part2732.0

"All yours," smiled Hagrid.

All Harry
part2733.0
's -- it was incredible. The Dursleys c
part2734.0
ouldn't have known about
this or they'd
part2735.0
 have had it from him faster than blink
part2736.0
ing. How often had
they complained how 
part2737.0
much Harry cost them to keep? And all t
part2738.0
he time there
had been a small fortune 
part2739.0
belonging to him, buried deep under Lon
part2740.0
don.

Hagrid helped Harry pile some of 
part2741.0
it into a bag.

"The gold ones are Gall
part2742.0
eons," he explained. "Seventeen silver 
part2743.0
Sickles to
a Galleon and twenty-nine Kn
part2744.0
uts to a Sickle, it's easy enough. Righ
part2745.0
t,
that should be enough fer a couple o
part2746.0
' terms, we'll keep the rest safe
for y
part2747.0
eh." He turned to Griphook. "Vault seve
part2748.0
n hundred and thirteen now,
please, and
part2749.0
 can we go more slowly?"

"One speed on
part2750.0
ly," said Griphook.

They were going ev
part2751.0
en deeper now and gathering speed. The 
part2752.0
air became
colder and colder as they hu
part2753.0
rtled round tight corners. They went
ra
part2754.0
ttling over an underground ravine, and 
part2755.0
Harry leaned over the side to
try to se
part2756.0
e what was down at the dark bottom, but
part2757.0
 Hagrid groaned and
pulled him back by 
part2758.0
the scruff of his neck.

Vault seven hu
part2759.0
ndred and thirteen had no keyhole.

"St
part2760.0
and back," said Griphook importantly. H
part2761.0
e stroked the door gently with
one of h
part2762.0
is long fingers and it simply melted aw
part2763.0
ay.

"If anyone but a Gringotts goblin 
part2764.0
tried that, they'd be sucked through
th
part2765.0
e door and trapped in there," said Grip
part2766.0
hook.

"How often do you check to see i
part2767.0
f anyone's inside?" Harry asked.

"Abou
part2768.0
t once every ten years," said Griphook 
part2769.0
with a rather nasty grin.

Something re
part2770.0
ally extraordinary had to be inside thi
part2771.0
s top security vault,
Harry was sure, a
part2772.0
nd he leaned forward eagerly, expecting
part2773.0
 to see fabulous
jewels at the very lea
part2774.0
st -- but at first he thought it was em
part2775.0
pty. Then
he noticed a grubby little pa
part2776.0
ckage wrapped up in brown paper lying o
part2777.0
n
the floor. Hagrid picked it up and tu
part2778.0
cked it deep inside his coat. Harry
lon
part2779.0
ged to know what it was, but knew bette
part2780.0
r than to ask.

"Come on, back in this 
part2781.0
infernal cart, and don't talk to me on 
part2782.0
the way
back, it's best if I keep me mo
part2783.0
uth shut," said Hagrid.

One wild cart 
part2784.0
ride later they stood blinking in the s
part2785.0
unlight outside
Gringotts. Harry didn't
part2786.0
 know where to run first now that he ha
part2787.0
d a bag
full of money. He didn't have t
part2788.0
o know how many Galleons there were to 
part2789.0
a
pound to know that he was holding mor
part2790.0
e money than he'd had in his whole
life
part2791.0
 -- more money than even Dudley had eve
part2792.0
r had.

"Might as well get yer uniform,
part2793.0
" said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam
Mal
part2794.0
kin's Robes for All Occasions. "Listen,
part2795.0
 Harry, would yeh mind if I
slipped off
part2796.0
 fer a pick-me-up in the Leaky Cauldron
part2797.0
? I hate them
Gringotts carts." He did 
part2798.0
still look a bit sick, so Harry entered
part2799.0
 Madam
Malkin's shop alone, feeling ner
part2800.0
vous.

Madam Malkin was a squat, smilin
part2801.0
g witch dressed all in mauve.

"Hogwart
part2802.0
s, clear?" she said, when Harry started
part2803.0
 to speak. "Got the lot
here -- another
part2804.0
 young man being fitted up just now, in
part2805.0
 fact. "

In the back of the shop, a bo
part2806.0
y with a pale, pointed face was standin
part2807.0
g on
a footstool while a second witch p
part2808.0
inned up his long black robes. Madam
Ma
part2809.0
lkin stood Harry on a stool next to him
part2810.0
) slipped a long robe over his
head, an
part2811.0
d began to pin it to the right length.

part2812.0

"Hello," said the boy, "Hogwarts, too?
part2813.0
"

"Yes," said Harry.

"My father's nex
part2814.0
t door buying my books and mother's up 
part2815.0
the street
looking at wands," said the 
part2816.0
boy. He had a bored, drawling voice. "T
part2817.0
hen
I'm going to drag them off to took 
part2818.0
at racing brooms. I don't see why
first
part2819.0
 years can't have their own. I think I'
part2820.0
ll bully father into getting
me one and
part2821.0
 I'll smuggle it in somehow."

Harry wa
part2822.0
s strongly reminded of Dudley.

"Have y
part2823.0
ou got your own broom?" the boy went on
part2824.0
.

"No," said Harry.

"Play Quidditch a
part2825.0
t all?"

"No," Harry said again, wonder
part2826.0
ing what on earth Quidditch could be.


part2827.0
"I do -- Father says it's a crime if I'
part2828.0
m not picked to play for my
house, and 
part2829.0
I must say, I agree. Know what house yo
part2830.0
u'll be in yet?"

"No," said Harry, fee
part2831.0
ling more stupid by the minute.

"Well,
part2832.0
 no one really knows until they get the
part2833.0
re, do they, but I know
I'll be in Slyt
part2834.0
herin, all our family have been -- imag
part2835.0
ine being in
Hufflepuff, I think I'd le
part2836.0
ave, wouldn't you?" "Mmm," said Harry, 
part2837.0
wishing
he could say something a bit mo
part2838.0
re interesting.

"I say, look at that m
part2839.0
an!" said the boy suddenly, nodding tow
part2840.0
ard the
front window. Hagrid was standi
part2841.0
ng there, grinning at Harry and pointin
part2842.0
g
at two large ice creams to show he co
part2843.0
uldn't come in.

"That's Hagrid," said 
part2844.0
Harry, pleased to know something the bo
part2845.0
y didn't.
"He works at Hogwarts."

"Oh,
part2846.0
" said the boy, "I've heard of him. He'
part2847.0
s a sort of servant, isn't
he?"

"He's 
part2848.0
the gamekeeper," said Harry. He was lik
part2849.0
ing the boy less and less
every second.
part2850.0


"Yes, exactly. I heard he's a sort of
part2851.0
 savage -- lives in a hut on the
school
part2852.0
 grounds and every now and then he gets
part2853.0
 drunk, tries to do magic,
and ends up 
part2854.0
setting fire to his bed."

"I think he'
part2855.0
s brilliant," said Harry coldly.

"Do y
part2856.0
ou?" said the boy, with a slight sneer.
part2857.0
 "Why is he with you? Where
are your pa
part2858.0
rents?"

"They're dead," said Harry sho
part2859.0
rtly. He didn't feel much like going in
part2860.0
to
the matter with this boy.

"Oh, sorr
part2861.0
y," said the other,. not sounding sorry
part2862.0
 at all. "But they were
our kind, weren
part2863.0
't they?"

"They were a witch and wizar
part2864.0
d, if that's what you mean."

"I really
part2865.0
 don't think they should let the other 
part2866.0
sort in, do you? They're
just not the s
part2867.0
ame, they've never been brought up to k
part2868.0
now our ways. Some
of them have never e
part2869.0
ven heard of Hogwarts until they get th
part2870.0
e letter,
imagine. I think they should 
part2871.0
keep it in the old wizarding families.

part2872.0
What's your surname, anyway?"

But befo
part2873.0
re Harry could answer, Madam Malkin sai
part2874.0
d, "That's you done, my
dear," and Harr
part2875.0
y, not sorry for an excuse to stop talk
part2876.0
ing to the boy,
hopped down from the fo
part2877.0
otstool.

"Well, I'll see you at Hogwar
part2878.0
ts, I suppose," said the drawling boy.

part2879.0

Harry was rather quiet as he ate the i
part2880.0
ce cream Hagrid had bought him
(chocola
part2881.0
te and raspberry with chopped nuts).

"
part2882.0
What's up?" said Hagrid.

"Nothing," Ha
part2883.0
rry lied. They stopped to buy parchment
part2884.0
 and quills. Harry
cheered up a bit whe
part2885.0
n he found a bottle of ink that changed
part2886.0
 color as you
wrote. When they had left
part2887.0
 the shop, he said, "Hagrid, what's Qui
part2888.0
dditch?"

"Blimey, Harry, I keep forget
part2889.0
tin' how little yeh know -- not knowin'
part2890.0

about Quidditch!"

"Don't make me feel
part2891.0
 worse," said Harry. He told Hagrid abo
part2892.0
ut the pate
boy in Madam Malkin's.

"--
part2893.0
and he said people from Muggle families
part2894.0
 shouldn't even be allowed
in."

"Yer n
part2895.0
ot from a Muggle family. If he'd known 
part2896.0
who yeh were -- he's grown
up knowin' y
part2897.0
er name if his parents are wizardin' fo
part2898.0
lk. You saw what
everyone in the Leaky 
part2899.0
Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. An
part2900.0
yway, what
does he know about it, some 
part2901.0
o' the best I ever saw were the only on
part2902.0
es
with magic in 'em in a long line 0' 
part2903.0
Muggles -- look at yer mum! Look
what s
part2904.0
he had fer a sister!"

"So what is Quid
part2905.0
ditch?"

"It's our sport. Wizard sport.
part2906.0
 It's like -- like soccer in the Muggle
part2907.0

world -- everyone follows Quidditch --
part2908.0
 played up in the air on
broomsticks an
part2909.0
d there's four balls -- sorta hard ter 
part2910.0
explain the rules."
"And what are Slyth
part2911.0
erin and Hufflepuff?"

"School houses. 
part2912.0
There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff 
part2913.0
are a lot o'
duffers, but --"

"I bet I
part2914.0
'm in Hufflepuff" said Harry gloomily.

part2915.0

"Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin," sa
part2916.0
id Hagrid darkly. "There's not a
single
part2917.0
 witch or wizard who went bad who wasn'
part2918.0
t in Slytherin.
You-Know-Who was one."

part2919.0

"Vol-, sorry - You-Know-Who was at Hog
part2920.0
warts?"

"Years an' years ago," said Ha
part2921.0
grid.

They bought Harry's school books
part2922.0
 in a shop called Flourish and Blotts
w
part2923.0
here the shelves were stacked to the ce
part2924.0
iling with books as large as
paving sto
part2925.0
nes bound in leather; books the size of
part2926.0
 postage stamps in
covers of silk; book
part2927.0
s full of peculiar symbols and a few bo
part2928.0
oks with
nothing in them at all. Even D
part2929.0
udley, who never read anything, would h
part2930.0
ave
been wild to get his hands on some 
part2931.0
of these. Hagrid almost had to drag
Har
part2932.0
ry away from Curses and Countercurses (
part2933.0
Bewitch Your Friends and
Befuddle Your 
part2934.0
Enemies with the Latest Revenges: Hair 
part2935.0

part2936.0
h, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Vi
part2937.0
ridian.

"I was trying to find out how 
part2938.0
to curse Dudley."

"I'm not sayin' that
part2939.0
's not a good idea, but yer not ter use
part2940.0
 magic in the
Muggle world except in ve
part2941.0
ry special circumstances," said Hagrid.
part2942.0
 "An'
anyway, yeh couldn' work any of t
part2943.0
hem curses yet, yeh'll need a lot more

part2944.0
study before yeh get ter that level."


part2945.0
Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy a solid g
part2946.0
old cauldron, either ("It says
pewter o
part2947.0
n yer list"), but they got a nice set o
part2948.0
f scales for weighing
potion ingredient
part2949.0
s and a collapsible brass telescope. Th
part2950.0
en they visited
the Apothecary, which w
part2951.0
as fascinating enough to make up for it
part2952.0
s horrible
smell, a mixture of bad eggs
part2953.0
 and rotted cabbages. Barrels of slimy 
part2954.0
stuff
stood on the floor; jars of herbs
part2955.0
, dried roots, and bright powders lined
part2956.0

the walls; bundles of feathers, string
part2957.0
s of fangs, and snarled claws hung
from
part2958.0
 the ceiling. While Hagrid asked the ma
part2959.0
n behind the counter for a
supply of so
part2960.0
me basic potion ingredients for Harry, 
part2961.0
Harry himself
examined silver unicorn h
part2962.0
orns at twenty-one Galleons each and mi
part2963.0
nuscule,
glittery-black beetle eyes (fi
part2964.0
ve Knuts a scoop).

Outside the Apothec
part2965.0
ary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.
part2966.0


"Just yer wand left - A yeah, an' I s
part2967.0
till haven't got yeh a birthday
present
part2968.0
."

Harry felt himself go red.

"You do
part2969.0
n't have to --"

"I know I don't have t
part2970.0
o. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. 
part2971.0
Not a toad,
toads went outta fashion ye
part2972.0
ars ago, yeh'd be laughed at - an' I do
part2973.0
n'
like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll
part2974.0
 get yer an owl. All the kids want
owls
part2975.0
, they're dead useful, carry yer mail a
part2976.0
n' everythin'."

Twenty minutes later, 
part2977.0
they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which h
part2978.0
ad been
dark and full of rustling and f
part2979.0
lickering, jewel-bright eyes. Harry now
part2980.0

carried a large cage that held a beaut
part2981.0
iful snowy owl, fast asleep with
her he
part2982.0
ad under her wing. He couldn't stop sta
part2983.0
mmering his thanks,
sounding just like 
part2984.0
Professor Quirrell.

"Don' mention it,"
part2985.0
 said Hagrid gruffly. "Don' expect you'
part2986.0
ve had a lotta
presents from them Dursl
part2987.0
eys. Just Ollivanders left now - only p
part2988.0
lace fer
wands, Ollivanders, and yeh go
part2989.0
tta have the best wand."

A magic wand.
part2990.0
.. this was what Harry had been really 
part2991.0
looking forward to.

The last shop was 
part2992.0
narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters
part2993.0
 over the door
read Ollivanders: Makers
part2994.0
 of Fine Wands since 382 B.C. A single 
part2995.0
wand lay
on a faded purple cushion in t
part2996.0
he dusty window.

A tinkling bell rang 
part2997.0
somewhere in the depths of the shop as 
part2998.0
they stepped
inside. It was a tiny plac
part2999.0
e, empty except for a single, spindly c
part3000.0
hair
that Hagrid sat on to wait. Harry 
part3001.0
felt strangely as though he had
entered
part3002.0
 a very strict library; he swallowed a 
part3003.0
lot of new questions that
had just occu
part3004.0
rred to him and looked instead at the t
part3005.0
housands of narrow
boxes piled neatly r
part3006.0
ight up to the ceiling. For some reason
part3007.0
, the back of
his neck prickled. The ve
part3008.0
ry dust and silence in here seemed to t
part3009.0
ingle
with some secret magic.

"Good af
part3010.0
ternoon," said a soft voice. Harry jump
part3011.0
ed. Hagrid must have
jumped, too, becau
part3012.0
se there was a loud crunching noise and
part3013.0
 he got quickly
off the spindly chair.

part3014.0

An old man was standing before them, h
part3015.0
is wide, pale eyes shining like
moons t
part3016.0
hrough the gloom of the shop.

"Hello,"
part3017.0
 said Harry awkwardly.

"Ah yes," said 
part3018.0
the man. "Yes, yes. I thought I'd be se
part3019.0
eing you soon.
Harry Potter." It wasn't
part3020.0
 a question. "You have your mother's ey
part3021.0
es. It
seems only yesterday she was in 
part3022.0
here herself, buying her first wand. Te
part3023.0
n
and a quarter inches long, swishy, ma
part3024.0
de of willow. Nice wand for charm
work.
part3025.0
"

Mr. Ollivander moved closer to Harry
part3026.0
. Harry wished he would blink. Those
si
part3027.0
lvery eyes were a bit creepy.

"Your fa
part3028.0
ther, on the other hand, favored a maho
part3029.0
gany wand. Eleven inches.
Pliable. A li
part3030.0
ttle more power and excellent for trans
part3031.0
figuration. Well, I
say your father fav
part3032.0
ored it -- it's really the wand that ch
part3033.0
ooses the
wizard, of course."

Mr. Olli
part3034.0
vander had come so close that he and Ha
part3035.0
rry were almost nose to
nose. Harry cou
part3036.0
ld see himself reflected in those misty
part3037.0
 eyes.

"And that's where..."

Mr. Olli
part3038.0
vander touched the lightning scar on Ha
part3039.0
rry's forehead with a
long, white finge
part3040.0
r.

"I'm sorry to say I sold the wand t
part3041.0
hat did it," he said softly.
"Thirteen-
part3042.0
and-a-half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, 
part3043.0
very powerful, and in
the wrong hands..
part3044.0
. well, if I'd known what that wand was
part3045.0
 going out into
the world to do...."

H
part3046.0
e shook his head and then, to Harry's r
part3047.0
elief, spotted Hagrid.

"Rubeus! Rubeus
part3048.0
 Hagrid! How nice to see you again.... 
part3049.0
Oak, sixteen
inches, rather bendy, wasn
part3050.0
't it?"

"It was, sir, yes," said Hagri
part3051.0
d.

"Good wand, that one. But I suppose
part3052.0
 they snapped it in half when you got
e
part3053.0
xpelled?" said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly
part3054.0
 stern.

"Er -- yes, they did, yes," sa
part3055.0
id Hagrid, shuffling his feet. "I've st
part3056.0
ill
got the pieces, though," he added b
part3057.0
rightly.

"But you don't use them?" sai
part3058.0
d Mr. Ollivander sharply.

"Oh, no, sit
part3059.0
," said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed h
part3060.0
e gripped his pink
umbrella very tightl
part3061.0
y as he spoke.

"Hmmm," said Mr. Olliva
part3062.0
nder, giving Hagrid a piercing look. "W
part3063.0
ell, now
-- Mr. Potter. Let me see." He
part3064.0
 pulled a long tape measure with silver
part3065.0

markings out of his pocket. "Which is 
part3066.0
your wand arm?"

"Er -- well, I'm right
part3067.0
-handed," said Harry.

"Hold out your a
part3068.0
rm. That's it." He measured Harry from 
part3069.0
shoulder to
finger, then wrist to elbow
part3070.0
, shoulder to floor, knee to armpit and
part3071.0
 round
his head. As he measured, he sai
part3072.0
d, "Every Ollivander wand has a core of
part3073.0

a powerful magical substance, Mr. Pott
part3074.0
er. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix
tail 
part3075.0
feathers, and the heartstrings of drago
part3076.0
ns. No two Ollivander wands
are the sam
part3077.0
e, just as no two unicorns, dragons, or
part3078.0
 phoenixes are quite
the same. And of c
part3079.0
ourse, you will never get such good res
part3080.0
ults with
another wizard's wand."

Harr
part3081.0
y suddenly realized that the tape measu
part3082.0
re, which was measuring
between his nos
part3083.0
trils, was doing this on its own. Mr. O
part3084.0
llivander was
flitting around the shelv
part3085.0
es, taking down boxes.

"That will do,"
part3086.0
 he said, and the tape measure crumpled
part3087.0
 into a heap on
the floor. "Right then,
part3088.0
 Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood an
part3089.0
d dragon
heartstring. Nine inches. Nice
part3090.0
 and flexible. just take it and give it
part3091.0
 a
wave."

Harry took the wand and (fee
part3092.0
ling foolish) waved it around a bit, bu
part3093.0
t Mr.
Ollivander snatched it out of his
part3094.0
 hand almost at once.

"Maple and phoen
part3095.0
ix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy.
part3096.0
 Try --"

Harry tried -- but he had har
part3097.0
dly raised the wand when it, too, was
s
part3098.0
natched back by Mr. Ollivander.

"No, n
part3099.0
o -here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight 
part3100.0
and a half inches, springy.
Go on, go o
part3101.0
n, try it out."

Harry tried. And tried
part3102.0
. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander wa
part3103.0
s waiting
for. The pile of tried wands 
part3104.0
was mounting higher and higher on the
s
part3105.0
pindly chair, but the more wands Mr. Ol
part3106.0
livander pulled from the
shelves, the h
part3107.0
appier he seemed to become.

"Tricky cu
part3108.0
stomer, eh? Not to worry, we'll find th
part3109.0
e perfect match here
somewhere -- I won
part3110.0
der, now - - yes, why not -- unusual co
part3111.0
mbination --
holly and phoenix feather,
part3112.0
 eleven inches, nice and supple."

Harr
part3113.0
y took the wand. He felt a sudden warmt
part3114.0
h in his fingers. He raised
the wand ab
part3115.0
ove his head, brought it swishing down 
part3116.0
through the dusty air
and a stream of r
part3117.0
ed and gold sparks shot from the end li
part3118.0
ke a firework,
throwing dancing spots o
part3119.0
f light on to the walls. Hagrid whooped
part3120.0
 and
clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, 
part3121.0
"Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very
good.
part3122.0
 Well, well, well... how curious... how
part3123.0
 very curious... "

He put Harry's wand
part3124.0
 back into its box and wrapped it in br
part3125.0
own paper,
still muttering, "Curious...
part3126.0
 curious..

"Sorry," said Harry, "but w
part3127.0
hat's curious?"

Mr. Ollivander fixed H
part3128.0
arry with his pale stare.

"I remember 
part3129.0
every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. 
part3130.0
Every single wand. It
so happens that t
part3131.0
he phoenix whose tail feather is in you
part3132.0
r wand, gave
another feather -- just on
part3133.0
e other. It is very curious indeed that
part3134.0
 you
should be destined for this wand w
part3135.0
hen its brother why, its brother gave
y
part3136.0
ou that scar."

Harry swallowed.

"Yes,
part3137.0
 thirteen-and-a-half inches. Yew. Curio
part3138.0
us indeed how these things
happen. The 
part3139.0
wand chooses the wizard, remember.... I
part3140.0
 think we must expect
great things from
part3141.0
 you, Mr. Potter.... After all, He-
Who
part3142.0
-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things -- 
part3143.0
terrible, yes, but great."

Harry shive
part3144.0
red. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Olliva
part3145.0
nder too much. He paid
seven gold Galle
part3146.0
ons for his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bo
part3147.0
wed them from his
shop.

The late after
part3148.0
noon sun hung low in the sky as Harry a
part3149.0
nd Hagrid made
their way back down Diag
part3150.0
on Alley, back through the wall, back t
part3151.0
hrough
the Leaky Cauldron, now empty. H
part3152.0
arry didn't speak at all as they walked
part3153.0

down the road; he didn't even notice h
part3154.0
ow much people were gawking at
them on 
part3155.0
the Underground, laden as they were wit
part3156.0
h all their funny-shaped
packages, with
part3157.0
 the snowy owl asleep in its cage on Ha
part3158.0
rry's lap. Up
another escalator, out in
part3159.0
to Paddington station; Harry only reali
part3160.0
zed
where they were when Hagrid tapped 
part3161.0
him on the shoulder.

"Got time fer a b
part3162.0
ite to eat before yer train leaves," he
part3163.0
 said.

He bought Harry a hamburger and
part3164.0
 they sat down on plastic seats to eat

part3165.0
them. Harry kept looking around. Everyt
part3166.0
hing looked so strange, somehow.

"You 
part3167.0
all right, Harry? Yer very quiet," said
part3168.0
 Hagrid.

Harry wasn't sure he could ex
part3169.0
plain. He'd just had the best birthday 
part3170.0
of
his life -- and yet -- he chewed his
part3171.0
 hamburger, trying to find the
words.


part3172.0
"Everyone thinks I'm special," he said 
part3173.0
at last. "All those people in the
Leaky
part3174.0
 Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Olli
part3175.0
vander... but I don't know
anything abo
part3176.0
ut magic at all. How can they expect gr
part3177.0
eat things? I'm
famous and I can't even
part3178.0
 remember what I'm famous for. I don't 
part3179.0
know what
happened when Vol-, sorry -- 
part3180.0
I mean, the night my parents died."

Ha
part3181.0
grid leaned across the table. Behind th
part3182.0
e wild beard and eyebrows he
wore a ver
part3183.0
y kind smile.

"Don' you worry, Harry. 
part3184.0
You'll learn fast enough. Everyone star
part3185.0
ts at the
beginning at Hogwarts, you'll
part3186.0
 be just fine. just be yerself. I know 
part3187.0
it's
hard. Yeh've been singled out, an'
part3188.0
 that's always hard. But yeh'll have a

part3189.0
great time at Hogwarts -- I did -- stil
part3190.0
l do, 'smatter of fact."

Hagrid helped
part3191.0
 Harry on to the train that would take 
part3192.0
him back to the
Dursleys, then handed h
part3193.0
im an envelope.

"Yer ticket fer Hogwar
part3194.0
ts, " he said. "First o' September -- K
part3195.0
ing's Cross
-- it's all on yer ticket. 
part3196.0
Any problems with the Dursleys, send me
part3197.0
 a
letter with yer owl, she'll know whe
part3198.0
re to find me.... See yeh soon,
Harry."
part3199.0


The train pulled out of the station. 
part3200.0
Harry wanted to watch Hagrid until
he w
part3201.0
as out of sight; he rose in his seat an
part3202.0
d pressed his nose against
the window, 
part3203.0
but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.

THE JOURNEY FROM PLATFORM N
part3205.0
INE AND THREE-QUARTERS

Harry's last mo
part3206.0
nth with the Dursleys wasn't fun. True,
part3207.0
 Dudley was now so
scared of Harry he w
part3208.0
ouldn't stay in the same room, while Au
part3209.0
nt Petunia
and Uncle Vernon didn't shut
part3210.0
 Harry in his cupboard, force him to do
part3211.0

anything, or shout at him -- in fact, 
part3212.0
they didn't speak to him at all.
Half t
part3213.0
errified, half furious, they acted as t
part3214.0
hough any chair with Harry
in it were e
part3215.0
mpty. Although this was an improvement 
part3216.0
in many ways, it did
become a bit depre
part3217.0
ssing after a while.

Harry kept to his
part3218.0
 room, with his new owl for company. He
part3219.0
 had decided to
call her Hedwig, a name
part3220.0
 he had found in A History of Magic. Hi
part3221.0
s school
books were very interesting. H
part3222.0
e lay on his bed reading late into the

part3223.0
night, Hedwig swooping in and out of th
part3224.0
e open window as she pleased. It
was lu
part3225.0
cky that Aunt Petunia didn't come in to
part3226.0
 vacuum anymore, because
Hedwig kept br
part3227.0
inging back dead mice. Every night befo
part3228.0
re he went to
sleep, Harry ticked off a
part3229.0
nother day on the piece of paper he had
part3230.0
 pinned
to the wall, counting down to S
part3231.0
eptember the first.

On the last day of
part3232.0
 August he thought he'd better speak to
part3233.0
 his aunt and
uncle about getting to Ki
part3234.0
ng's Cross station the next day, so he 
part3235.0
went
down to the living room where they
part3236.0
 were watching a quiz show on
televisio
part3237.0
n. He cleared his throat to let them kn
part3238.0
ow he was there, and
Dudley screamed an
part3239.0
d ran from the room.

"Er -- Uncle Vern
part3240.0
on?"

Uncle Vernon grunted to show he w
part3241.0
as listening.

"Er -- I need to be at K
part3242.0
ing's Cross tomorrow to -- to go to Hog
part3243.0
warts."

Uncle Vernon grunted again.

"
part3244.0
Would it be all right if you gave me a 
part3245.0
lift?"

Grunt. Harry supposed that mean
part3246.0
t yes.

"Thank you."

He was about to g
part3247.0
o back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actua
part3248.0
lly spoke.

"Funny way to get to a wiza
part3249.0
rds' school, the train. Magic carpets a
part3250.0
ll got
punctures, have they?"

Harry di
part3251.0
dn't say anything.

"Where is this scho
part3252.0
ol, anyway?"

"I don't know," said Harr
part3253.0
y, realizing this for the first time. H
part3254.0
e pulled
the ticket Hagrid had given hi
part3255.0
m out of his pocket.

"I just take the 
part3256.0
train from platform nine and three-quar
part3257.0
ters at eleven
o'clock," he read.

His 
part3258.0
aunt and uncle stared.

"Platform what?
part3259.0
"

"Nine and three-quarters."

"Don't t
part3260.0
alk rubbish," said Uncle Vernon. "There
part3261.0
 is no platform nine and
three-quarters
part3262.0
."

"It's on my ticket."

"Barking," sa
part3263.0
id Uncle Vernon, "howling mad, the lot 
part3264.0
of them. You'll see.
You just wait. All
part3265.0
 right, we'll take you to King's Cross.
part3266.0
 We're going up
to London tomorrow anyw
part3267.0
ay, or I wouldn't bother."

"Why are yo
part3268.0
u going to London?" Harry asked, trying
part3269.0
 to keep things
friendly.

"Taking Dudl
part3270.0
ey to the hospital," growled Uncle Vern
part3271.0
on. "Got to have that
ruddy tail remove
part3272.0
d before he goes to Smeltings."

Harry 
part3273.0
woke at five o'clock the next morning a
part3274.0
nd was too excited and
nervous to go ba
part3275.0
ck to sleep. He got up and pulled on hi
part3276.0
s jeans because
he didn't want to walk 
part3277.0
into the station in his wizard's robes 
part3278.0
-- he'd
change on the train. He checked
part3279.0
 his Hogwarts list yet again to make su
part3280.0
re
he had everything he needed, saw tha
part3281.0
t Hedwig was shut safely in her
cage, a
part3282.0
nd then paced the room, waiting for the
part3283.0
 Dursleys to get up. Two
hours later, H
part3284.0
arry's huge, heavy trunk had been loade
part3285.0
d into the
Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia 
part3286.0
had talked Dudley into sitting next to

part3287.0
Harry, and they had set off.

They reac
part3288.0
hed King's Cross at half past ten. Uncl
part3289.0
e Vernon dumped Harry's
trunk onto a ca
part3290.0
rt and wheeled it into the station for 
part3291.0
him. Harry thought
this was strangely k
part3292.0
ind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, fa
part3293.0
cing the
platforms with a nasty grin on
part3294.0
 his face.

"Well, there you are, boy. 
part3295.0
Platform nine -- platform ten. Your pla
part3296.0
tform
should be somewhere in the middle
part3297.0
, but they don't seem to have built it

part3298.0
yet, do they?"

He was quite right, of 
part3299.0
course. There was a big plastic number 
part3300.0
nine over
one platform and a big plasti
part3301.0
c number ten over the one next to it, a
part3302.0
nd
in the middle, nothing at all.

"Hav
part3303.0
e a good term," said Uncle Vernon with 
part3304.0
an even nastier smile. He
left without 
part3305.0
another word. Harry turned and saw the 
part3306.0
Dursleys drive away.
All three of them 
part3307.0
were laughing. Harry's mouth went rathe
part3308.0
r dry. What on
earth was he going to do
part3309.0
? He was starting to attract a lot of f
part3310.0
unny
looks, because of Hedwig. He'd hav
part3311.0
e to ask someone.

He stopped a passing
part3312.0
 guard, but didn't dare mention platfor
part3313.0
m nine and
three-quarters. The guard ha
part3314.0
d never heard of Hogwarts and when Harr
part3315.0
y
couldn't even tell him what part of t
part3316.0
he country it was in, he started to
get
part3317.0
 annoyed, as though Harry was being stu
part3318.0
pid on purpose. Getting
desperate, Harr
part3319.0
y asked for the train that left at elev
part3320.0
en o'clock, but
the guard said there wa
part3321.0
sn't one. In the end the guard strode a
part3322.0
way,
muttering about time wasters. Harr
part3323.0
y was now trying hard not to panic.
Acc
part3324.0
ording to the large clock over the arri
part3325.0
vals board, he had ten minutes
left to 
part3326.0
get on the train to Hogwarts and he had
part3327.0
 no idea how to do it; he
was stranded 
part3328.0
in the middle of a station with a trunk
part3329.0
 he could hardly
lift, a pocket full of
part3330.0
 wizard money, and a large owl.

Hagrid
part3331.0
 must have forgotten to tell him someth
part3332.0
ing you had to do, like
tapping the thi
part3333.0
rd brick on the left to get into Diagon
part3334.0
 Alley. He
wondered if he should get ou
part3335.0
t his wand and start tapping the ticket
part3336.0

inspector's stand between platforms ni
part3337.0
ne and ten.

At that moment a group of 
part3338.0
people passed just behind him and he ca
part3339.0
ught a
few words of what they were sayi
part3340.0
ng.

"-- packed with Muggles, of course
part3341.0
 --"

Harry swung round. The speaker wa
part3342.0
s a plump woman who was talking to four
part3343.0

boys, all with flaming red hair. Each 
part3344.0
of them was pushing a trunk like
Harry'
part3345.0
s in front of him -- and they had an ow
part3346.0
l.

Heart hammering, Harry pushed his c
part3347.0
art after them. They stopped and so
did
part3348.0
 he, just near enough to hear what they
part3349.0
 were saying.

"Now, what's the platfor
part3350.0
m number?" said the boys' mother.

"Nin
part3351.0
e and three-quarters!" piped a small gi
part3352.0
rl, also red-headed, who was
holding he
part3353.0
r hand, "Mom, can't I go... "

"You're 
part3354.0
not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. Al
part3355.0
l right, Percy, you go
first."

What lo
part3356.0
oked like the oldest boy marched toward
part3357.0
 platforms nine and ten.
Harry watched,
part3358.0
 careful not to blink in case he missed
part3359.0
 it -- but just as
the boy reached the 
part3360.0
dividing barrier between the two platfo
part3361.0
rms, a large
crowd of tourists came swa
part3362.0
rming in front of him and by the time t
part3363.0
he last
backpack had cleared away, the 
part3364.0
boy had vanished.

"Fred, you next," th
part3365.0
e plump woman said.

"I'm not Fred, I'm
part3366.0
 George," said the boy. "Honestly, woma
part3367.0
n, you call
yourself our mother? CarA y
part3368.0
ou tell I'm George?"

"Sorry, George, d
part3369.0
ear."

"Only joking, I am Fred," said t
part3370.0
he boy, and off he went. His twin calle
part3371.0
d
after him to hurry up, and he must ha
part3372.0
ve done so, because a second later,
he 
part3373.0
had gone -- but how had he done it?

No
part3374.0
w the third brother was walking briskly
part3375.0
 toward the barrier he was
almost there
part3376.0
 -- and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't
part3377.0
 anywhere.

There was nothing else for 
part3378.0
it.

"Excuse me," Harry said to the plu
part3379.0
mp woman.

"Hello, dear," she said. "Fi
part3380.0
rst time at Hogwarts? Ron's new, too."

part3381.0

She pointed at the last and youngest o
part3382.0
f her sons. He was tall, thin, and
gang
part3383.0
ling, with freckles, big hands and feet
part3384.0
, and a long nose.

"Yes," said Harry. 
part3385.0
"The thing is -- the thing is, I don't 
part3386.0
know how to
--"

"How to get onto the p
part3387.0
latform?" she said kindly, and Harry no
part3388.0
dded.

"Not to worry," she said. "All y
part3389.0
ou have to do is walk straight at the
b
part3390.0
arrier between platforms nine and ten. 
part3391.0
Don't stop and don't be scared
you'll c
part3392.0
rash into it, that's very important. Be
part3393.0
st do it at a bit of a
run if you're ne
part3394.0
rvous. Go on, go now before Ron."

"Er 
part3395.0
-- okay," said Harry.

He pushed his tr
part3396.0
olley around and stared at the barrier.
part3397.0
 It looked very
solid.

He started to w
part3398.0
alk toward it. People jostled him on th
part3399.0
eir way to
platforms nine and ten. Harr
part3400.0
y walked more quickly. He was going to 
part3401.0
smash
right into that barrier and then 
part3402.0
he'd be in trouble -- leaning forward
o
part3403.0
n his cart, he broke into a heavy run -
part3404.0
- the barrier was coming nearer
and nea
part3405.0
rer -- he wouldn't be able to stop -- t
part3406.0
he cart was out of control
-- he was a 
part3407.0
foot away -- he closed his eyes ready f
part3408.0
or the crash --

It didn't come... he k
part3409.0
ept on running... he opened his eyes. A
part3410.0
 scarlet
steam engine was waiting next 
part3411.0
to a platform packed with people. A sig
part3412.0
n
overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleve
part3413.0
n O'clock. Harry looked behind him
and 
part3414.0
saw a wrought-iron archway where the ba
part3415.0
rrier had been, with the
words Platform
part3416.0
 Nine and Three-Quarters on it, He had 
part3417.0
done it.

Smoke from the engine drifted
part3418.0
 over the heads of the chattering crowd
part3419.0
,
while cats of every color wound here 
part3420.0
and there between their legs. Owls
hoot
part3421.0
ed to one another in a disgruntled sort
part3422.0
 of way over the babble and
the scrapin
part3423.0
g of heavy trunks.

The first few carri
part3424.0
ages were already packed with students,
part3425.0
 some hanging
out of the window to talk
part3426.0
 to their families, some fighting over 
part3427.0
seats.
Harry pushed his cart off down t
part3428.0
he platform in search of an empty seat.
part3429.0

He passed a round-faced boy who was sa
part3430.0
ying, "Gran, I've lost my toad
again."

part3431.0

"Oh, Neville," he heard the old woman 
part3432.0
sigh.

A boy with dreadlocks was surrou
part3433.0
nded by a small crowd.

"Give us a look
part3434.0
, Lee, go on."

The boy lifted the lid 
part3435.0
of a box in his arms, and the people ar
part3436.0
ound him
shrieked and yelled as somethi
part3437.0
ng inside poked out a long, hairy leg.

part3438.0

Harry pressed on through the crowd unt
part3439.0
il he found an empty compartment
near t
part3440.0
he end of the train. He put Hedwig insi
part3441.0
de first and then started
to shove and 
part3442.0
heave his trunk toward the train door. 
part3443.0
He tried to lift it
up the steps but co
part3444.0
uld hardly raise one end and twice he d
part3445.0
ropped it
painfully on his foot.

"Want
part3446.0
 a hand?" It was one of the red-haired 
part3447.0
twins he'd followed through
the barrier
part3448.0
.

"Yes, please," Harry panted.

"Oy, F
part3449.0
red! C'mere and help!"

With the twins'
part3450.0
 help, Harry's trunk was at last tucked
part3451.0
 away in a corner
of the compartment.


part3452.0
"Thanks," said Harry, pushing his sweat
part3453.0
y hair out of his eyes.

"What's that?"
part3454.0
 said one of the twins suddenly, pointi
part3455.0
ng at Harry's
lightning scar.

"Blimey,
part3456.0
" said the other twin. "Are you

"He is
part3457.0
," said the first twin. "Aren't you?" h
part3458.0
e added to Harry.

"What?" said Harry.

part3459.0

"Harry Potter, "chorused the twins.

"
part3460.0
Oh, him," said Harry. "I mean, yes, I a
part3461.0
m."

The two boys gawked at him, and Ha
part3462.0
rry felt himself turning red. Then, to

part3463.0
his relief, a voice came floating in th
part3464.0
rough the train's open door.

"Fred? Ge
part3465.0
orge? Are you there?"

"Coming, Mom."


part3466.0
With a last look at Harry, the twins ho
part3467.0
pped off the train.

Harry sat down nex
part3468.0
t to the window where, half hidden, he 
part3469.0
could watch the
red-haired family on th
part3470.0
e platform and hear what they were sayi
part3471.0
ng. Their
mother had just taken out her
part3472.0
 handkerchief.

"Ron, you've got someth
part3473.0
ing on your nose."

The youngest boy tr
part3474.0
ied to jerk out of the way, but she gra
part3475.0
bbed him and
began rubbing the end of h
part3476.0
is nose.

"Mom -- geroff" He wriggled f
part3477.0
ree.

"Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somef
part3478.0
ink on his nosie?" said one of the
twin
part3479.0
s.

"Shut up," said Ron.

"Where's Perc
part3480.0
y?" said their mother.

"He's coming no
part3481.0
w."

The oldest boy came striding into 
part3482.0
sight. He had already changed into his

part3483.0
billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Har
part3484.0
ry noticed a shiny silver badge
on his 
part3485.0
chest with the letter P on it.

"Can't 
part3486.0
stay long, Mother," he said. "I'm up fr
part3487.0
ont, the prefects have got
two compartm
part3488.0
ents to themselves --"

"Oh, are you a 
part3489.0
prefect, Percy?" said one of the twins,
part3490.0
 with an air of
great surprise. "You sh
part3491.0
ould have said something, we had no ide
part3492.0
a."

"Hang on, I think I remember him s
part3493.0
aying something about it," said the
oth
part3494.0
er twin. "Once --"

"Or twice --"

"A m
part3495.0
inute --"

"All summer --"

"Oh, shut u
part3496.0
p," said Percy the Prefect.

"How come 
part3497.0
Percy gets new robes, anyway?" said one
part3498.0
 of the twins.

"Because he's a prefect
part3499.0
," said their mother fondly. "All right
part3500.0
, dear,
well, have a good term -- send 
part3501.0
me an owl when you get there."

She kis
part3502.0
sed Percy on the cheek and he left. The
part3503.0
n she turned to the twins.

"Now, you t
part3504.0
wo -- this year, you behave yourselves.
part3505.0
 If I get one more owl
telling me you'v
part3506.0
e -- you've blown up a toilet or --"

"
part3507.0
Blown up a toilet? We've never blown up
part3508.0
 a toilet."

"Great idea though, thanks
part3509.0
, Mom."

"It's not funny. And look afte
part3510.0
r Ron."

"Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins
part3511.0
 is safe with us."

"Shut up," said Ron
part3512.0
 again. He was almost as tall as the tw
part3513.0
ins already
and his nose was still pink
part3514.0
 where his mother had rubbed it.

"Hey,
part3515.0
 Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met
part3516.0
 on the train?"

Harry leaned back quic
part3517.0
kly so they couldn't see him looking.


part3518.0
"You know that black-haired boy who was
part3519.0
 near us in the station? Know who
he is
part3520.0
?"

"Who?"

"Harry Potter!"

Harry hear
part3521.0
d the little girl's voice.

"Oh, Mom, c
part3522.0
an I go on the train and see him, Mom, 
part3523.0
eh please...."

"You've already seen hi
part3524.0
m, Ginny, and the poor boy isn't someth
part3525.0
ing you
goggle at in a zoo. Is he reall
part3526.0
y, Fred? How do you know?"

"Asked him.
part3527.0
 Saw his scar. It's really there - like
part3528.0
 lightning."

"Poor dear - no wonder he
part3529.0
 was alone, I wondered. He was ever so 
part3530.0
polite
when he asked how to get onto th
part3531.0
e platform."

"Never mind that, do you 
part3532.0
think he remembers what You-Know-Who lo
part3533.0
oks
like?"

Their mother suddenly becam
part3534.0
e very stern.

"I forbid you to ask him
part3535.0
, Fred. No, don't you dare. As though h
part3536.0
e needs
reminding of that on his first 
part3537.0
day at school."

"All right, keep your 
part3538.0
hair on."

A whistle sounded.

"Hurry u
part3539.0
p!" their mother said, and the three bo
part3540.0
ys clambered onto the
train. They leane
part3541.0
d out of the window for her to kiss the
part3542.0
m good-bye, and
their younger sister be
part3543.0
gan to cry.

"Don't, Ginny, we'll send 
part3544.0
you loads of owls."

"We'll send you a 
part3545.0
Hogwarts toilet seat."

"George!"

"Onl
part3546.0
y joking, Mom."

The train began to mov
part3547.0
e. Harry saw the boys' mother waving an
part3548.0
d their
sister, half laughing, half cry
part3549.0
ing, running to keep up with the train

part3550.0
until it gathered too much speed, then 
part3551.0
she fell back and waved.

Harry watched
part3552.0
 the girl and her mother disappear as t
part3553.0
he train rounded the
corner. Houses fla
part3554.0
shed past the window. Harry felt a grea
part3555.0
t leap of
excitement. He didn't know wh
part3556.0
at he was going to but it had to be bet
part3557.0
ter
than what he was leaving behind.

T
part3558.0
he door of the compartment slid open an
part3559.0
d the youngest redheaded boy
came in.


part3560.0
"Anyone sitting there?" he asked, point
part3561.0
ing at the seat opposite Harry.
"Everyw
part3562.0
here else is full."

Harry shook his he
part3563.0
ad and the boy sat down. He glanced at 
part3564.0
Harry and then
looked quickly out of th
part3565.0
e window, pretending he hadn't looked. 
part3566.0
Harry saw
he still had a black mark on 
part3567.0
his nose.

"Hey, Ron."

The twins were 
part3568.0
back.

"Listen, we're going down the mi
part3569.0
ddle of the train -- Lee Jordan's got a
part3570.0

giant tarantula down there."

"Right,"
part3571.0
 mumbled Ron.

"Harry," said the other 
part3572.0
twin, "did we introduce ourselves? Fred
part3573.0
 and
George Weasley. And this is Ron, o
part3574.0
ur brother. See you later, then.

"Bye,
part3575.0
" said Harry and Ron. The twins slid th
part3576.0
e compartment door shut
behind them.

"
part3577.0
Are you really Harry Potter?" Ron blurt
part3578.0
ed out.

Harry nodded.

"Oh -well, I th
part3579.0
ought it might be one of Fred and Georg
part3580.0
e's jokes," said
Ron. "And have you rea
part3581.0
lly got -- you know..."

He pointed at 
part3582.0
Harry's forehead.

Harry pulled back hi
part3583.0
s bangs to show the lightning scar. Ron
part3584.0
 stared.

"So that's where You-Know-Who
part3585.0


"Yes," said Harry, "but I can't remem
part3586.0
ber it."

"Nothing?" said Ron eagerly.

part3587.0

"Well -- I remember a lot of green lig
part3588.0
ht, but nothing else."

"Wow," said Ron
part3589.0
. He sat and stared at Harry for a few 
part3590.0
moments, then, as
though he had suddenl
part3591.0
y realized what he was doing, he looked
part3592.0
 quickly out
of the window again.

"Are
part3593.0
 all your family wizards?" asked Harry,
part3594.0
 who found Ron just as
interesting as R
part3595.0
on found him.

"Er -- Yes, I think so,"
part3596.0
 said Ron. "I think Mom's got a second 
part3597.0
cousin
who's an accountant, but we neve
part3598.0
r talk about him."

"So you must know l
part3599.0
oads of magic already."

The Weasleys w
part3600.0
ere clearly one of those old wizarding 
part3601.0
families the pale
boy in Diagon Alley h
part3602.0
ad talked about.

"I heard you went to 
part3603.0
live with Muggles," said Ron. "What are
part3604.0
 they like?"

"Horrible -well, not all 
part3605.0
of them. My aunt and uncle and cousin a
part3606.0
re,
though. Wish I'd had three wizard b
part3607.0
rothers."

"Five," said Ron. For some r
part3608.0
eason, he was looking gloomy. "I'm the 
part3609.0
sixth
in our family to go to Hogwarts. 
part3610.0
You could say I've got a lot to live up
part3611.0

to. Bill and Charlie have already left
part3612.0
 -- Bill was head boy and Charlie
was c
part3613.0
aptain of Quidditch. Now Percy's a pref
part3614.0
ect. Fred and George mess
around a lot,
part3615.0
 but they still get really good marks a
part3616.0
nd everyone thinks
they're really funny
part3617.0
. Everyone expects me to do as well as 
part3618.0
the others,
but if I do, it's no big de
part3619.0
al, because they did it first. You neve
part3620.0
r get
anything new, either, with five b
part3621.0
rothers. I've got Bill's old robes,
Cha
part3622.0
rlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat."

part3623.0

Ron reached inside his jacket and pull
part3624.0
ed out a fat gray rat, which was
asleep
part3625.0
.

"His name's Scabbers and he's useles
part3626.0
s, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy
got a
part3627.0
n owl from my dad for being made a pref
part3628.0
ect, but they couldn't aff
-- I mean, I
part3629.0
 got Scabbers instead."

Ron's ears wen
part3630.0
t pink. He seemed to think he'd said to
part3631.0
o much, because he
went back to staring
part3632.0
 out of the window.

Harry didn't think
part3633.0
 there was anything wrong with not bein
part3634.0
g able to
afford an owl. After all, he'
part3635.0
d never had any money in his life until
part3636.0
 a
month ago, and he told Ron so, all a
part3637.0
bout having to wear Dudley's old
clothe
part3638.0
s and never getting proper birthday pre
part3639.0
sents. This seemed to cheer
Ron up.

".
part3640.0
.. and until Hagrid told me, I didn't k
part3641.0
now anything about be ing a
wizard or a
part3642.0
bout my parents or Voldemort"

Ron gasp
part3643.0
ed.

"What?" said Harry.

"You said You
part3644.0
-Know-Who's name!" said Ron, sounding b
part3645.0
oth shocked and
impressed. "I'd have th
part3646.0
ought you, of all people --"

"I'm not 
part3647.0
trying to be brave or anything, saying 
part3648.0
the name," said Harry, I
just never kne
part3649.0
w you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've 
part3650.0
got loads to
learn.... I bet," he added
part3651.0
, voicing for the first time something 
part3652.0
that
had been worrying him a lot lately
part3653.0
, "I bet I'm the worst in the class."


part3654.0
"You won't be. There's loads of people 
part3655.0
who come from Muggle families and
they 
part3656.0
learn quick enough."

While they had be
part3657.0
en talking, the train had carried them 
part3658.0
out of London.
Now they were speeding p
part3659.0
ast fields full of cows and sheep. They
part3660.0
 were
quiet for a time, watching the fi
part3661.0
elds and lanes flick past.

Around half
part3662.0
 past twelve there was a great clatteri
part3663.0
ng outside in the
corridor and a smilin
part3664.0
g, dimpled woman slid back their door a
part3665.0
nd said,
"Anything off the cart, dears?
part3666.0
"

Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast,
part3667.0
 leapt to his feet, but Ron's ears
went
part3668.0
 pink again and he muttered that he'd b
part3669.0
rought sandwiches. Harry went
out into 
part3670.0
the corridor.

He had never had any mon
part3671.0
ey for candy with the Dursleys, and now
part3672.0
 that he
had pockets rattling with gold
part3673.0
 and silver he was ready to buy as many
part3674.0

Mars Bars as he could carry -- but the
part3675.0
 woman didn't have Mars Bars. What
she 
part3676.0
did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavo
part3677.0
r Beans, Drooble's Best
Blowing Gum, Ch
part3678.0
ocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldro
part3679.0
n Cakes, Licorice
Wands, and a number o
part3680.0
f other strange things Harry had never 
part3681.0
seen in his
life. Not wanting to miss a
part3682.0
nything, he got some of everything and 
part3683.0
paid
the woman eleven silver Sickles an
part3684.0
d seven bronze Knuts.

Ron stared as Ha
part3685.0
rry brought it all back in to the compa
part3686.0
rtment and tipped
it onto an empty seat
part3687.0
.

"Hungry, are you?"

"Starving," said
part3688.0
 Harry, taking a large bite out of a pu
part3689.0
mpkin pasty.

Ron had taken out a lumpy
part3690.0
 package and unwrapped it. There were f
part3691.0
our
sandwiches inside. He pulled one of
part3692.0
 them apart and said, "She always
forge
part3693.0
ts I don't like corned beef."

"Swap yo
part3694.0
u for one of these," said Harry, holdin
part3695.0
g up a pasty. "Go on --"

"You don't wa
part3696.0
nt this, it's all dry," said Ron. "She 
part3697.0
hasn't got much
time," he added quickly
part3698.0
, "you know, with five of us."

"Go on,
part3699.0
 have a pasty," said Harry, who had nev
part3700.0
er had anything to share
before or, ind
part3701.0
eed, anyone to share it with. It was a 
part3702.0
nice feeling,
sitting there with Ron, e
part3703.0
ating their way through all Harry's pas
part3704.0
ties,
cakes, and candies (the sandwiche
part3705.0
s lay forgotten).

"What are these?" Ha
part3706.0
rry asked Ron, holding up a pack of Cho
part3707.0
colate Frogs.
"They're not really frogs
part3708.0
, are they?" He was starting to feel th
part3709.0
at
nothing would surprise him.

"No," s
part3710.0
aid Ron. "But see what the card is. I'm
part3711.0
 missing Agrippa."

"What?"

"Oh, of co
part3712.0
urse, you wouldn't know -- Chocolate Fr
part3713.0
ogs have cards, inside
them, you know, 
part3714.0
to collect -- famous witches and wizard
part3715.0
s. I've got about
five hundred, but I h
part3716.0
aven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy."

Harry 
part3717.0
unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked
part3718.0
 up the card. It showed a
man's face. H
part3719.0
e wore half- moon glasses, had a long, 
part3720.0
crooked nose, and
flowing silver hair, 
part3721.0
beard, and mustache. Underneath the pic
part3722.0
ture was the
name Albus Dumbledore.

"S
part3723.0
o this is Dumbledore!" said Harry.

"Do
part3724.0
n't tell me you'd never heard of Dumble
part3725.0
dore!" said Ron. "Can I have a
frog? I 
part3726.0
might get Agrippa -- thanks

Harry turn
part3727.0
ed over his card and read:

ALBUS DUMBL
part3728.0
EDORE

CURRENTLY HEADMASTER OF HOGWARTS
part3729.0


Considered by many the greatest wizar
part3730.0
d of modern times, Dumbledore is
partic
part3731.0
ularly famous for his defeat of the dar
part3732.0
k wizard Grindelwald in
1945, for the d
part3733.0
iscovery of the twelve uses of dragon's
part3734.0
 blood, and his
work on alchemy with hi
part3735.0
s partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Du
part3736.0
mbledore
enjoys chamber music and tenpi
part3737.0
n bowling.

Harry turned the card back 
part3738.0
over and saw, to his astonishment, that
part3739.0

Dumbledore's face had disappeared.

"H
part3740.0
e's gone!"

"Well, you can't expect him
part3741.0
 to hang around all day," said Ron. "He
part3742.0
'll be
back. No, I've got Morgana again
part3743.0
 and I've got about six of her... do yo
part3744.0
u
want it? You can start collecting."


part3745.0
Ron's eyes strayed to the pile of Choco
part3746.0
late Frogs waiting to be
unwrapped.

"H
part3747.0
elp yourself," said Harry. "But in, you
part3748.0
 know, the Muggle world, people
just st
part3749.0
ay put in photos."

"Do they? What, the
part3750.0
y don't move at all?" Ron sounded amaze
part3751.0
d. "weird!"

Harry stared as Dumbledore
part3752.0
 sidled back into the picture on his ca
part3753.0
rd and
gave him a small smile. Ron was 
part3754.0
more interested in eating the frogs tha
part3755.0
n
looking at the Famous Witches and Wiz
part3756.0
ards cards, but Harry couldn't keep
his
part3757.0
 eyes off them. Soon he had not only Du
part3758.0
mbledore and Morgana, but
Hengist of Wo
part3759.0
odcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Parac
part3760.0
elsus, and Merlin.
He finally tore his 
part3761.0
eyes away from the druidess Cliodna, wh
part3762.0
o was
scratching her nose, to open a ba
part3763.0
g of Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

part3764.0

"You want to be careful with those," R
part3765.0
on warned Harry. "When they say
every f
part3766.0
lavor, they mean every flavor -- you kn
part3767.0
ow, you get all the
ordinary ones like 
part3768.0
chocolate and peppermint and mar- malad
part3769.0
e, but then
you can get spinach and liv
part3770.0
er and tripe. George reckons he had a b
part3771.0
ooger-
flavored one once."

Ron picked 
part3772.0
up a green bean, looked at it carefully
part3773.0
, and bit into a
corner.

"Bleaaargh --
part3774.0
 see? Sprouts."

They had a good time e
part3775.0
ating the Every Flavor Beans. Harry got
part3776.0
 toast,
coconut, baked bean, strawberry
part3777.0
, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and wa
part3778.0
s
even brave enough to nibble the end o
part3779.0
ff a funny gray one Ron wouldn't
touch,
part3780.0
 which turned out to be pepper.

The co
part3781.0
untryside now flying past the window wa
part3782.0
s becoming wilder. The neat
fields had 
part3783.0
gone. Now there were woods, twisting ri
part3784.0
vers, and dark green
hills.

There was 
part3785.0
a knock on the door of their compartmen
part3786.0
t and the round-faced
boy Harry had pas
part3787.0
sed on platform nine and threequarters 
part3788.0
came in. He
looked tearful.

"Sorry," h
part3789.0
e said, "but have you seen a toad at al
part3790.0
l?"

When they shook their heads, he wa
part3791.0
iled, "I've lost him! He keeps getting

part3792.0
away from me!"

"He'll turn up," said H
part3793.0
arry.

"Yes," said the boy miserably. "
part3794.0
Well, if you see him..."

He left.

"Do
part3795.0
n't know why he's so bothered," said Ro
part3796.0
n. "If I'd brought a toad I'd
lose it a
part3797.0
s quick as I could. Mind you, I brought
part3798.0
 Scabbers, so I can't
talk."

The rat w
part3799.0
as still snoozing on Ron's lap.

"He mi
part3800.0
ght have died and you wouldn't know the
part3801.0
 difference," said Ron in
disgust. "I t
part3802.0
ried to turn him yellow yesterday to ma
part3803.0
ke him more
interesting, but the spell 
part3804.0
didn't work. I'll show you, look..."

H
part3805.0
e rummaged around in his trunk and pull
part3806.0
ed out a very battered-looking
wand. It
part3807.0
 was chipped in places and something wh
part3808.0
ite was glinting at the
end.

"Unicorn 
part3809.0
hair's nearly poking out. Anyway

He ha
part3810.0
d just raised his 'wand when the compar
part3811.0
tment door slid open again.
The toadles
part3812.0
s boy was back, but this time he had a 
part3813.0
girl with him. She was
already wearing 
part3814.0
her new Hogwarts robes.

"Has anyone se
part3815.0
en a toad? Neville's lost one," she sai
part3816.0
d. She had a bossy
sort of voice, lots 
part3817.0
of bushy brown hair, and rather large f
part3818.0
ront teeth.

"We've already told him we
part3819.0
 haven't seen it," said Ron, but the gi
part3820.0
rl
wasn't listening, she was looking at
part3821.0
 the wand in his hand.

"Oh, are you do
part3822.0
ing magic? Let's see it, then."

She sa
part3823.0
t down. Ron looked taken aback.

"Er --
part3824.0
 all right."

He cleared his throat.

"
part3825.0
Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn 
part3826.0
this stupid, fat rat yellow."

He waved
part3827.0
 his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbe
part3828.0
rs stayed gray and fast
asleep.

"Are y
part3829.0
ou sure that's a real spell?" said the 
part3830.0
girl. "Well, it's not very
good, is it?
part3831.0
 I've tried a few simple spells just fo
part3832.0
r practice and it's
all worked for me. 
part3833.0
Nobody in my family's magic at all, it 
part3834.0
was ever such
a surprise when I got my 
part3835.0
letter, but I was ever so pleased, of c
part3836.0
ourse, I
mean, it's the very best schoo
part3837.0
l of witchcraft there is, I've heard --
part3838.0

I've learned all our course books by h
part3839.0
eart, of course, I just hope it
will be
part3840.0
 enough -- I'm Hermione Granger, by the
part3841.0
 way, who are you.

She said all this v
part3842.0
ery fast.

Harry looked at Ron, and was
part3843.0
 relieved to see by his stunned face th
part3844.0
at he
hadn't learned all the course boo
part3845.0
ks by heart either.

"I'm Ron Weasley,"
part3846.0
 Ron muttered.

"Harry Potter," said Ha
part3847.0
rry.

"Are you really?" said Hermione. 
part3848.0
"I know all about you, of course -- I
g
part3849.0
ot a few extra books. for background re
part3850.0
ading, and you're in Modern
Magical His
part3851.0
tory and The Rise and Fall of the Dark 
part3852.0
Arts and Great
Wizarding Events of the 
part3853.0
Twentieth Century.

"Am I?" said Harry,
part3854.0
 feeling dazed.

"Goodness, didn't you 
part3855.0
know, I'd have found out everything I c
part3856.0
ould if it
was me," said Hermione. "Do 
part3857.0
either of you know what house you'll be
part3858.0
 in?
I've been asking around, and I hop
part3859.0
e I'm in Gryffindor, it sounds by far
t
part3860.0
he best; I hear Dumbledore himself was 
part3861.0
in it, but I suppose Ravenclaw
wouldn't
part3862.0
 be too bad.... Anyway, we'd better go 
part3863.0
and look for Neville's
toad. You two ha
part3864.0
d better change, you know, I expect we'
part3865.0
ll be there
soon."

And she left, takin
part3866.0
g the toadless boy with her.

"Whatever
part3867.0
 house I'm in, I hope she's not in it,"
part3868.0
 said Ron. He threw his
wand back into 
part3869.0
his trunk. "Stupid spell -- George gave
part3870.0
 it to me, bet he
knew it was a dud."


part3871.0
"What house are your brothers in?" aske
part3872.0
d Harry.

"Gryffindor," said Ron. Gloom
part3873.0
 seemed to be settling on him again. "M
part3874.0
om
and Dad were in it, too. I don't kno
part3875.0
w what they'll say if I'm not. I
don't 
part3876.0
suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but
part3877.0
 imagine if they put me in
Slytherin."

part3878.0

"That's the house Vol-, I mean, You-Kn
part3879.0
ow-Who was in?"

"Yeah," said Ron. He f
part3880.0
lopped back into his seat, looking depr
part3881.0
essed.

"You know, I think the ends of 
part3882.0
Scabbers' whiskers are a bit lighter,"

part3883.0
said Harry, trying to take Ron's mind o
part3884.0
ff houses. "So what do your
oldest brot
part3885.0
hers do now that they've left, anyway?"
part3886.0


Harry was wondering what a wizard did
part3887.0
 once he'd finished school.

"Charlie's
part3888.0
 in Romania studying dragons, and Bill'
part3889.0
s in Africa doing
something for Gringot
part3890.0
ts," said Ron. "Did you hear about

Gri
part3891.0
ngotts? It's been all over the Daily Pr
part3892.0
ophet, but I don't suppose you
get that
part3893.0
 with the Muggles -- someone tried to r
part3894.0
ob a high security
vault."

Harry stare
part3895.0
d.

"Really? What happened to them?"

"
part3896.0
Nothing, that's why it's such big news.
part3897.0
 They haven't been caught. My
dad says 
part3898.0
it must've been a powerful Dark wizard 
part3899.0
to get round Gringotts,
but they don't 
part3900.0
think they took anything, that's what's
part3901.0
 odd. 'Course,
everyone gets scared whe
part3902.0
n something like this happens in case
Y
part3903.0
ou-Know-Who's behind it."

Harry turned
part3904.0
 this news over in his mind. He was sta
part3905.0
rting to get a
prickle of fear every ti
part3906.0
me You- Know-Who was mentioned. He supp
part3907.0
osed this
was all part of entering the 
part3908.0
magical world, but it had been a lot mo
part3909.0
re
comfortable saying "Voldemort" witho
part3910.0
ut worrying.

"What's your Quidditch te
part3911.0
am?" Ron asked.

"Er -- I don't know an
part3912.0
y," Harry confessed.

"What!" Ron looke
part3913.0
d dumbfounded. "Oh, you wait, it's the 
part3914.0
best game in the
world --" And he was o
part3915.0
ff, explaining all about the four balls
part3916.0
 and the
positions of the seven players
part3917.0
, describing famous games he'd been to

part3918.0
with his brothers and the broomstick he
part3919.0
'd like to get if he had the
money. He 
part3920.0
was just taking Harry through the finer
part3921.0
 points of the game
when the compartmen
part3922.0
t door slid open yet again, but it wasn
part3923.0
't Neville the
toadless boy, or Hermion
part3924.0
e Granger this time.

Three boys entere
part3925.0
d, and Harry recognized the middle one 
part3926.0
at once: it was
the pale boy from Madam
part3927.0
 Malkin's robe shop. He was looking at 
part3928.0
Harry with
a lot more interest than he'
part3929.0
d shown back in Diagon Alley.

"Is it t
part3930.0
rue?" he said. "They're saying all down
part3931.0
 the train that Harry
Potter's in this 
part3932.0
compartment. So it's you, is it?"

"Yes
part3933.0
," said Harry. He was looking at the ot
part3934.0
her boys. Both of them were
thickset an
part3935.0
d looked extremely mean. Standing on ei
part3936.0
ther side of the pale
boy, they looked 
part3937.0
like bodyguards.

"Oh, this is Crabbe a
part3938.0
nd this is Goyle," said the pale boy ca
part3939.0
relessly,
noticing where Harry was look
part3940.0
ing. "And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfo
part3941.0
y."

Ron gave a slight cough, which mig
part3942.0
ht have been hiding a snigget. Draco
Ma
part3943.0
lfoy looked at him.

"Think my name's f
part3944.0
unny, do you? No need to ask who you ar
part3945.0
e. My father
told me all the Weasleys h
part3946.0
ave red hair, freckles, and more childr
part3947.0
en than
they can afford."

He turned ba
part3948.0
ck to Harry. "You'll soon find out some
part3949.0
 wizarding families
are much better tha
part3950.0
n others, Potter. You don't want to go 
part3951.0
making friends
with the wrong sort. I c
part3952.0
an help you there."

He held out his ha
part3953.0
nd to shake Harry's, but Harry didn't t
part3954.0
ake it.

"I think I can tell who the wr
part3955.0
ong sort are for myself, thanks," he sa
part3956.0
id
coolly.

Draco Malfoy didn't go red,
part3957.0
 but a pink tinge appeared in his pale

part3958.0
cheeks.

"I'd be careful if I were you,
part3959.0
 Potter," he said slowly. "Unless you'r
part3960.0
e a
bit politer you'll go the same way 
part3961.0
as your parents. They didn't know
what 
part3962.0
was good for them, either. You hang aro
part3963.0
und with riffraff like the
Weasleys and
part3964.0
 that Hagrid, and it'll rub off on you.
part3965.0
"

Both Harry and Ron stood up.

"Say t
part3966.0
hat again," Ron said, his face as red a
part3967.0
s his hair.

"Oh, you're going to fight
part3968.0
 us, are you?" Malfoy sneered.

"Unless
part3969.0
 you get out now," said Harry, more bra
part3970.0
vely than he felt, because
Crabbe and G
part3971.0
oyle were a lot bigger than him or Ron.
part3972.0


"But we don't feet like leaving, do w
part3973.0
e, boys? We've eaten all our food
and y
part3974.0
ou still seem to have some."

Goyle rea
part3975.0
ched toward the Chocolate Frogs next to
part3976.0
 Ron - Ron leapt
forward, but before he
part3977.0
'd so much as touched Goyle, Goyle let 
part3978.0
out a
horrible yell.

Scabbers the rat 
part3979.0
was hanging off his finger, sharp littl
part3980.0
e teeth sunk
deep into Goyle's knuckle 
part3981.0
- Crabbe and Malfoy backed away as Goyl
part3982.0
e swung
Scabbers round and round, howli
part3983.0
ng, and when Scabbets finally flew off

part3984.0
and hit the window, all three of them d
part3985.0
isappeared at once. Perhaps they
though
part3986.0
t there were more rats lurking among th
part3987.0
e sweets, or perhaps they'd
heard foots
part3988.0
teps, because a second later, Hermione 
part3989.0
Granger had come in.

"What has been go
part3990.0
ing on?" she said, looking at the sweet
part3991.0
s all over the
floor and Ron picking up
part3992.0
 Scabbers by his tail.

I think he's be
part3993.0
en knocked out," Ron said to Harry. He 
part3994.0
looked closer at
Scabbers. "No -- I don
part3995.0
't believe it -- he's gone back to slee
part3996.0
p-"

And so he had.

"You've met Malfoy
part3997.0
 before?"

Harry explained about their 
part3998.0
meeting in Diagon Alley.

"I've heard o
part3999.0
f his family," said Ron darkly. "They w
part4000.0
ere some of the
first to come back to o
part4001.0
ur side after You-Know-Who disappeared.
part4002.0
 Said
they'd been bewitched. My dad doe
part4003.0
sn't believe it. He says Malfoy's
fathe
part4004.0
r didn't need an excuse to go over to t
part4005.0
he Dark Side." He turned to
Hermione. "
part4006.0
Can we help you with something?"

"You'
part4007.0
d better hurry up and put your robes on
part4008.0
, I've just been up to the
front to ask
part4009.0
 the conductor, and he says we're nearl
part4010.0
y there. You haven't
been fighting, hav
part4011.0
e you? You'll be in trouble before we e
part4012.0
ven get there!"

"Scabbers has been fig
part4013.0
hting, not us," said Ron, scowling at h
part4014.0
er. "Would
you mind leaving while we ch
part4015.0
ange?"

"All right -- I only came in he
part4016.0
re because people outside are behaving

part4017.0
very childishly, racing up and down the
part4018.0
 corridors," said Hermione in a
sniffy 
part4019.0
voice. "And you've got dirt on your nos
part4020.0
e, by the way, did you
know?"

Ron glar
part4021.0
ed at her as she left. Harry peered out
part4022.0
 of the window. It was
getting dark. He
part4023.0
 could see mountains and forests under 
part4024.0
a deep purple
sky. The train did seem t
part4025.0
o be slowing down.

He and Ron took off
part4026.0
 their jackets and pulled on their long
part4027.0
 black robes.
Ron's were a bit short fo
part4028.0
r him, you could see his sneakers under
part4029.0
neath
them.

A voice echoed through the
part4030.0
 train: "We will be reaching Hogwarts i
part4031.0
n five
minutes' time. Please leave your
part4032.0
 luggage on the train, it will be taken
part4033.0

to the school separately."

Harry's st
part4034.0
omach lurched with nerves and Ron, he s
part4035.0
aw, looked pale under
his freckles. The
part4036.0
y crammed their pockets with the last o
part4037.0
f the sweets and
joined the crowd thron
part4038.0
ging the corridor.

The train slowed ri
part4039.0
ght down and finally stopped. People pu
part4040.0
shed their way
toward the door and out 
part4041.0
on to a tiny, dark platform. Harry shiv
part4042.0
ered in
the cold night air. Then a lamp
part4043.0
 came bobbing over the heads of the
stu
part4044.0
dents, and Harry heard a familiar voice
part4045.0
: "Firs' years! Firs' years
over here! 
part4046.0
All right there, Harry?"

Hagrid's big 
part4047.0
hairy face beamed over the sea of heads
part4048.0
.

"C'mon, follow me -- any more firs' 
part4049.0
years? Mind yer step, now! Firs'
years 
part4050.0
follow me!"

Slipping and stumbling, th
part4051.0
ey followed Hagrid down what seemed to 
part4052.0
be a
steep, narrow path. It was so dark
part4053.0
 on either side of them that Harry
thou
part4054.0
ght there must be thick trees there. No
part4055.0
body spoke much. Neville, the
boy who k
part4056.0
ept losing his toad, sniffed once or tw
part4057.0
ice.

"Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' H
part4058.0
ogwarts in a sec," Hagrid called over
h
part4059.0
is shoulder, "jus' round this bend here
part4060.0
."

There was a loud "Oooooh!"

The nar
part4061.0
row path had opened suddenly onto the e
part4062.0
dge of a great black take.
Perched atop
part4063.0
 a high mountain on the other side, its
part4064.0
 windows sparkling in
the starry sky, w
part4065.0
as a vast castle with many turrets and 
part4066.0
towers.

"No more'n four to a boat!" Ha
part4067.0
grid called, pointing to a fleet of lit
part4068.0
tle
boats sitting in the water by the s
part4069.0
hore. Harry and Ron were followed
into 
part4070.0
their boat by Neville and Hermione. "Ev
part4071.0
eryone in?" shouted Hagrid,
who had a b
part4072.0
oat to himself. "Right then -- FORWARD!
part4073.0
"

And the fleet of little boats moved 
part4074.0
off all at once, gliding across the
lak
part4075.0
e, which was as smooth as glass. Everyo
part4076.0
ne was silent, staring up at
the great 
part4077.0
castle overhead. It towered over them a
part4078.0
s they sailed nearer
and nearer to the 
part4079.0
cliff on which it stood.

"Heads down!"
part4080.0
 yelled Hagrid as the first boats reach
part4081.0
ed the cliff; they
all bent their heads
part4082.0
 and the little boats carried them thro
part4083.0
ugh a curtain
of ivy that hid a wide op
part4084.0
ening in the cliff face. They were carr
part4085.0
ied
along a dark tunnel, which seemed t
part4086.0
o be taking them right underneath the
c
part4087.0
astle, until they reached a kind of und
part4088.0
erground harbor, where they
clambered o
part4089.0
ut onto rocks and pebbles.

"Oy, you th
part4090.0
ere! Is this your toad?" said Hagrid, w
part4091.0
ho was checking the
boats as people cli
part4092.0
mbed out of them.

"Trevor!" cried Nevi
part4093.0
lle blissfully, holding out his hands. 
part4094.0
Then they
clambered up a passageway in 
part4095.0
the rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming ou
part4096.0
t at
last onto smooth, damp grass right
part4097.0
 in the shadow of the castle.

They wal
part4098.0
ked up a flight of stone steps and crow
part4099.0
ded around the huge, Oak
front door.

"
part4100.0
Everyone here? You there, still got yer
part4101.0
 toad?"

Hagrid raised a gigantic fist 
part4102.0
and knocked three times on the castle
d
part4103.0
oor.


CHAPTER SEVEN

THE SORTING HAT


part4104.0
The door swung open at once. A tall, bl
part4105.0
ack-haired witch in emerald-green
robes
part4106.0
 stood there. She had a very stern face
part4107.0
 and Harry's first thought
was that thi
part4108.0
s was not someone to cross.

"The firs'
part4109.0
 years, Professor McGonagall," said Hag
part4110.0
rid.

"Thank you, Hagrid. I will take t
part4111.0
hem from here."

She pulled the door wi
part4112.0
de. The entrance hall was so big you co
part4113.0
uld have
fit the whole of the Dursleys'
part4114.0
 house in it. The stone walls were lit

part4115.0
with flaming torches like the ones at G
part4116.0
ringotts, the ceiling was too
high to m
part4117.0
ake out, and a magnificent marble stair
part4118.0
case facing them led to
the upper floor
part4119.0
s.

They followed Professor McGonagall 
part4120.0
across the flagged stone floor. Harry
c
part4121.0
ould hear the drone of hundreds of voic
part4122.0
es from a doorway to the right
-the res
part4123.0
t of the school must already be here --
part4124.0
 but Professor McGonagall
showed the fi
part4125.0
rst years into a small, empty chamber o
part4126.0
ff the hall. They
crowded in, standing 
part4127.0
rather closer together than they would 
part4128.0
usually have
done, peering about nervou
part4129.0
sly.

"Welcome to Hogwarts," said Profe
part4130.0
ssor McGonagall. "The start-of-term
ban
part4131.0
quet will begin shortly, but before you
part4132.0
 take your seats in the Great
Hall, you
part4133.0
 will be sorted into your houses. The S
part4134.0
orting is a very
important ceremony bec
part4135.0
ause, while you are here, your house wi
part4136.0
ll be
something like your family within
part4137.0
 Hogwarts. You will have classes with
t
part4138.0
he rest of your house, sleep in your ho
part4139.0
use dormitory, and spend free
time in y
part4140.0
our house common room.

"The four house
part4141.0
s are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ra
part4142.0
venclaw, and
Slytherin. Each house has 
part4143.0
its own noble history and each has prod
part4144.0
uced
outstanding witches and wizards. W
part4145.0
hile you are at Hogwarts, your
triumphs
part4146.0
 will earn your house points, while any
part4147.0
 rulebreaking will lose
house points. A
part4148.0
t the end of the year, the house with t
part4149.0
he most points is
awarded the house cup
part4150.0
, a great honor. I hope each of you wil
part4151.0
l be a
credit to whichever house become
part4152.0
s yours.

"The Sorting Ceremony will ta
part4153.0
ke place in a few minutes in front of t
part4154.0
he
rest of the school. I suggest you al
part4155.0
l smarten yourselves up as much as
you 
part4156.0
can while you are waiting."

Her eyes l
part4157.0
ingered for a moment on Neville's cloak
part4158.0
, which was fastened
under his left ear
part4159.0
, and on Ron's smudged nose. Harry nerv
part4160.0
ously tried to
flatten his hair.

"I sh
part4161.0
all return when we are ready for you," 
part4162.0
said Professor McGonagall.
"Please wait
part4163.0
 quietly."

She left the chamber. Harry
part4164.0
 swallowed.

"How exactly do they sort 
part4165.0
us into houses?" he asked Ron.

"Some s
part4166.0
ort of test, I think. Fred said it hurt
part4167.0
s a lot, but I think he
was joking."

H
part4168.0
arry's heart gave a horrible jolt. A te
part4169.0
st? In front of the whole
school? But h
part4170.0
e didn't know any magic yet -- what on 
part4171.0
earth would he have
to do? He hadn't ex
part4172.0
pected something like this the moment t
part4173.0
hey arrived.
He looked around anxiously
part4174.0
 and saw that everyone else looked terr
part4175.0
ified,
too. No one was talking much exc
part4176.0
ept Hermione Granger, who was whisperin
part4177.0
g
very fast about all the spells she'd 
part4178.0
learned and wondering which one
she'd n
part4179.0
eed. Harry tried hard not to listen to 
part4180.0
her. He'd never been more
nervous, neve
part4181.0
r, not even when he'd had to take a sch
part4182.0
ool report home to
the Dursleys saying 
part4183.0
that he'd somehow turned his teacher's 
part4184.0
wig blue. He
kept his eyes fixed on the
part4185.0
 door. Any second now, Professor McGona
part4186.0
gall
would come back and lead him to hi
part4187.0
s doom.

Then something happened that m
part4188.0
ade him jump about a foot in the air --
part4189.0

several people behind him screamed.

"
part4190.0
What the --?"

He gasped. So did the pe
part4191.0
ople around him. About twenty ghosts ha
part4192.0
d just
streamed through the back wall. 
part4193.0
Pearly-white and slightly transparent,

part4194.0
they glided across the room talking to 
part4195.0
one another and hardly glancing
at the 
part4196.0
first years. They seemed to be arguing.
part4197.0
 What looked like a fat
little monk was
part4198.0
 saying: "Forgive and forget, I say, we
part4199.0
 ought to give him
a second chance --"

part4200.0

"My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeve
part4201.0
s all the chances he deserves? He
gives
part4202.0
 us all a bad name and you know, he's n
part4203.0
ot really even a ghost -- I
say, what a
part4204.0
re you all doing here?"

A ghost wearin
part4205.0
g a ruff and tights had suddenly notice
part4206.0
d the first years.

Nobody answered.

"
part4207.0
New students!" said the Fat Friar, smil
part4208.0
ing around at them. "About to be
Sorted
part4209.0
, I suppose?"

A few people nodded mute
part4210.0
ly.

"Hope to see you in Hufflepuff!" s
part4211.0
aid the Friar. "My old house, you
know.
part4212.0
"

"Move along now," said a sharp voice
part4213.0
. "The Sorting Ceremony's about to
star
part4214.0
t."

Professor McGonagall had returned.
part4215.0
 One by one, the ghosts floated away
th
part4216.0
rough the opposite wall.

"Now, form a 
part4217.0
line," Professor McGonagall told the fi
part4218.0
rst years, "and
follow me."

Feeling od
part4219.0
dly as though his legs had turned to le
part4220.0
ad, Harry got into line
behind a boy wi
part4221.0
th sandy hair, with Ron behind him, and
part4222.0
 they walked out
of the chamber, back a
part4223.0
cross the hall, and through a pair of d
part4224.0
ouble doors
into the Great Hall.

Harry
part4225.0
 had never even imagined such a strange
part4226.0
 and splendid place. It was
lit by thou
part4227.0
sands and thousands of candles that wer
part4228.0
e floating in midair
over four long tab
part4229.0
les, where the rest of the students wer
part4230.0
e sitting.
These tables were laid with 
part4231.0
glittering golden plates and goblets. A
part4232.0
t the
top of the hall was another long 
part4233.0
table where the teachers were sitting.

part4234.0
Professor McGonagall led the first year
part4235.0
s up here, so that they came to a
halt 
part4236.0
in a line facing the other students, wi
part4237.0
th the teachers behind them.
The hundre
part4238.0
ds of faces staring at them looked like
part4239.0
 pale lanterns in the
flickering candle
part4240.0
light. Dotted here and there among the 
part4241.0
students, the
ghosts shone misty silver
part4242.0
. Mainly to avoid all the staring eyes,
part4243.0
 Harry
looked upward and saw a velvety 
part4244.0
black ceiling dotted with stars. He
hea
part4245.0
rd

Hermione whisper, "Its bewitched to
part4246.0
 look like the sky outside. I read
abou
part4247.0
t it in Hogwarts, A History."

It was h
part4248.0
ard to believe there was a ceiling ther
part4249.0
e at all, and that the
Great Hall didn'
part4250.0
t simply open on to the heavens.

Harry
part4251.0
 quickly looked down again as Professor
part4252.0
 McGonagall silently placed
a four-legg
part4253.0
ed stool in front of the first years. O
part4254.0
n top of the stool she
put a pointed wi
part4255.0
zard's hat. This hat was patched and fr
part4256.0
ayed and
extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia 
part4257.0
wouldn't have let it in the house.

May
part4258.0
be they had to try and get a rabbit out
part4259.0
 of it, Harry thought wildly,
that seem
part4260.0
ed the sort of thing -- noticing that e
part4261.0
veryone in the hall was
now staring at 
part4262.0
the hat, he stared at it, too. For a fe
part4263.0
w seconds, there
was complete silence. 
part4264.0
Then the hat twitched. A rip near the b
part4265.0
rim opened
wide like a mouth -- and the
part4266.0
 hat began to sing:

"Oh, you may not t
part4267.0
hink I'm pretty,

But don't judge on wh
part4268.0
at you see,

I'll eat myself if you can
part4269.0
 find

A smarter hat than me.

You can 
part4270.0
keep your bowlers black,

Your top hats
part4271.0
 sleek and tall,

For I'm the Hogwarts 
part4272.0
Sorting Hat

And I can cap them all.

T
part4273.0
here's nothing hidden in your head

The
part4274.0
 Sorting Hat can't see,

So try me on a
part4275.0
nd I will tell you

Where you ought to 
part4276.0
be.

You might belong in Gryffindor,

W
part4277.0
here dwell the brave at heart,

Their d
part4278.0
aring, nerve, and chivalry Set Gryffind
part4279.0
ors apart;

You might belong in Hufflep
part4280.0
uff,

Where they are just and loyal,

T
part4281.0
hose patient Hufflepuffis are true And 
part4282.0
unafraid of toil;

Or yet in wise old R
part4283.0
avenclaw,

if you've a ready mind,

Whe
part4284.0
re those of wit and learning,

Will alw
part4285.0
ays find their kind;

Or perhaps in Sly
part4286.0
therin

You'll make your real friends,

part4287.0

Those cunning folk use any means

To a
part4288.0
chieve their ends.

So put me on! Don't
part4289.0
 be afraid!

And don't get in a flap!


part4290.0
You're in safe hands (though I have non
part4291.0
e)

For I'm a Thinking Cap!"

The whole
part4292.0
 hall burst into applause as the hat fi
part4293.0
nished its song. It
bowed to each of th
part4294.0
e four tables and then became quite sti
part4295.0
ll again.

"So we've just got to try on
part4296.0
 the hat!" Ron whispered to Harry. "I'l
part4297.0
l
kill Fred, he was going on about wres
part4298.0
tling a troll."

Harry. smiled weakly. 
part4299.0
Yes, trying on the hat was a lot better
part4300.0
 than
having to do a spell, but he did 
part4301.0
wish they could have tried it on
withou
part4302.0
t everyone watching. The hat seemed to 
part4303.0
be asking rather alot;
Harry didn't fee
part4304.0
l brave or quick-witted or any of it at
part4305.0
 the moment. If
only the hat had mentio
part4306.0
ned a house for people who felt a bit q
part4307.0
ueasy,
that would have been the one for
part4308.0
 him.

Professor McGonagall now stepped
part4309.0
 forward holding a long roll of
parchme
part4310.0
nt.

"When I call your name, you will p
part4311.0
ut on the hat and sit on the stool to
b
part4312.0
e sorted," she said. "Abbott, Hannah!"

part4313.0

A pink-faced girl with blonde pigtails
part4314.0
 stumbled out of line, put on the
hat, 
part4315.0
which fell right down over her eyes, an
part4316.0
d sat down. A moments pause
--

"HUFFLE
part4317.0
PUFF!" shouted the hat.

The table on t
part4318.0
he right cheered and clapped as Hannah 
part4319.0
went to sit down at
the Hufflepuff tabl
part4320.0
e. Harry saw the ghost of the Fat Friar
part4321.0
 waving
merrily at her.

"Bones, Susan!
part4322.0
"

"HUFFLEPUFF!" shouted the hat again,
part4323.0
 and Susan scuttled off to sit next
to 
part4324.0
Hannah.

"Boot, Terry!"

"RAVENCLAW!"


part4325.0
The table second from the left clapped 
part4326.0
this time; several Ravenclaws
stood up 
part4327.0
to shake hands with Terry as he joined 
part4328.0
them.

" Brocklehurst, Mandy" went to R
part4329.0
avenclaw too, but "Brown, Lavender"
bec
part4330.0
ame the first new Gryffindor, and the t
part4331.0
able on the far left exploded
with chee
part4332.0
rs; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers
part4333.0
 catcalling.

"Bulstrode, Millicent" th
part4334.0
en became a Slytherin. Perhaps it was H
part4335.0
arry's
imagination, after all he'd hear
part4336.0
d about Slytherin, but he thought they

part4337.0
looked like an unpleasant lot. He was s
part4338.0
tarting to feel definitely sick
now. He
part4339.0
 remembered being picked for teams duri
part4340.0
ng gym at his old school.
He had always
part4341.0
 been last to be chosen, not because he
part4342.0
 was no good, but
because no one wanted
part4343.0
 Dudley to think they liked him.

"Finc
part4344.0
h-Fletchley, Justin!"

"HUFFLEPUFF!"

S
part4345.0
ometimes, Harry noticed, the hat shoute
part4346.0
d out the house at once, but at
others 
part4347.0
it took a little while to decide. "Finn
part4348.0
igan, Seamus," the
sandy-haired boy nex
part4349.0
t to Harry in the line, sat on the stoo
part4350.0
l for almost
a whole minute before the 
part4351.0
hat declared him a Gryffindor.

"Grange
part4352.0
r, Hermione!"

Hermione almost ran to t
part4353.0
he stool and jammed the hat eagerly on 
part4354.0
her head.

"GRYFFINDOR!" shouted the ha
part4355.0
t. Ron groaned.

A horrible thought str
part4356.0
uck Harry, as horrible thoughts always 
part4357.0
do when
you're very nervous. What if he
part4358.0
 wasn't chosen at all? What if he just

part4359.0
sat there with the hat over his eyes fo
part4360.0
r ages, until Professor
McGonagall jerk
part4361.0
ed it off his head and said there had o
part4362.0
bviously been a
mistake and he'd better
part4363.0
 get back on the train?

When Neville L
part4364.0
ongbottom, the boy who kept losing his 
part4365.0
toad, was called,
he fell over on his w
part4366.0
ay to the stool. The hat took a long ti
part4367.0
me to decide
with Neville. When it fina
part4368.0
lly shouted, "GRYFFINDOR," Neville ran 
part4369.0
off
still wearing it, and had to jog ba
part4370.0
ck amid gales of laughter to give it
to
part4371.0
 "MacDougal, Morag."

Malfoy swaggered 
part4372.0
forward when his name was called and go
part4373.0
t his wish at
once: the hat had barely 
part4374.0
touched his head when it screamed, "SLY
part4375.0
THERIN!"

Malfoy went to join his frien
part4376.0
ds Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased wi
part4377.0
th
himself.

There weren't many people 
part4378.0
left now. "Moon" "Nott" "Parkinson" the
part4379.0
n a
pair of twin girls, "Patil" and "Pa
part4380.0
til" then "Perks, Sally-Anne" and
then,
part4381.0
 at last -- "Potter, Harry!"

As Harry 
part4382.0
stepped forward, whispers suddenly brok
part4383.0
e out like little
hissing fires all ove
part4384.0
r the hall.

"Potter, did she say?"

Th
part4385.0
e Harry Potter?"

The last thing Harry 
part4386.0
saw before the hat dropped over his eye
part4387.0
s was the
hall full of people craning t
part4388.0
o get a good look at him. Next second h
part4389.0
e
was looking at the black inside of th
part4390.0
e hat. He waited.

Hmm," said a small v
part4391.0
oice in his ear. "Difficult. Very diffi
part4392.0
cult. Plenty
of courage, I see. Not a b
part4393.0
ad mind either. There's talent, A my go
part4394.0
odness,
yes -- and a nice thirst to pro
part4395.0
ve yourself, now that's interesting....
part4396.0

So where shall I put you?"

Harry grip
part4397.0
ped the edges of the stool and thought,
part4398.0
 Not Slytherin, not
Slytherin.

"Not Sl
part4399.0
ytherin, eh?" said the small voice. "Ar
part4400.0
e you sure? You could be
great, you kno
part4401.0
w, it's all here in your head, and Slyt
part4402.0
herin will help you
on the way to great
part4403.0
ness, no doubt about that -- no? Well, 
part4404.0
if you're sure
-- better be GRYFFINDOR!
part4405.0
"

Harry heard the hat shout the last w
part4406.0
ord to the whole hall. He took off
the 
part4407.0
hat and walked shakily toward the Gryff
part4408.0
indor table. He was so
relieved to have
part4409.0
 been chosen and not put in Slytherin, 
part4410.0
he hardly noticed
that he was getting t
part4411.0
he loudest cheer yet. Percy the Prefect
part4412.0
 got up and
shook his hand vigorously, 
part4413.0
while the Weasley twins yelled, "We got
part4414.0

Potter! We got Potter!" Harry sat down
part4415.0
 opposite the ghost in the ruff
he'd se
part4416.0
en earlier. The ghost patted his arm, g
part4417.0
iving Harry the sudden,
horrible feelin
part4418.0
g he'd just plunged it into a bucket of
part4419.0
 ice-cold water.

He could see the High
part4420.0
 Table properly now. At the end nearest
part4421.0
 him sat
Hagrid, who caught his eye and
part4422.0
 gave him the thumbs up. Harry grinned

part4423.0
back. And there, in the center of the H
part4424.0
igh Table, in a large gold chair,
sat A
part4425.0
lbus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him a
part4426.0
t once from the card he'd
gotten out of
part4427.0
 the Chocolate Frog on the train. Dumbl
part4428.0
edore's silver hair
was the only thing 
part4429.0
in the whole hall that shone as brightl
part4430.0
y as the
ghosts. Harry spotted Professo
part4431.0
r Quirtell, too, the nervous young man

part4432.0
from the Leaky Cauldron. He was looking
part4433.0
 very peculiar in a large purple
turban
part4434.0
.

And now there were only three people
part4435.0
 left to be sorted. "Thomas, Dean,"
a B
part4436.0
lack boy even taller than Ron, joined H
part4437.0
arry at the Gryffindor table.
"Turpin, 
part4438.0
Lisa," became a Ravenclaw and then it w
part4439.0
as Ron's turn. He was
pale green by now
part4440.0
. Harry crossed his fingers under the t
part4441.0
able and a
second later the hat had sho
part4442.0
uted, "GRYFFINDOR!"

Harry clapped loud
part4443.0
ly with the rest as Ron collapsed into 
part4444.0
the chair next
to him.

"Well done, Ron
part4445.0
, excellent," said Percy Weasley Pompou
part4446.0
sly across Harry
as "Zabini, Blaise," w
part4447.0
as made a Slytherin. Professor McGonaga
part4448.0
ll rolled
up her scroll and took the So
part4449.0
rting Hat away.

Harry looked down at h
part4450.0
is empty gold plate. He had only just r
part4451.0
ealized how
hungry he was. The pumpkin 
part4452.0
pasties seemed ages ago.

Albus Dumbled
part4453.0
ore had gotten to his feet. He was beam
part4454.0
ing at the students,
his arms opened wi
part4455.0
de, as if nothing could have pleased hi
part4456.0
m more than to
see them all there.

"We
part4457.0
lcome," he said. "Welcome to a new year
part4458.0
 at Hogwarts! Before we begin
our banqu
part4459.0
et, I would like to say a few words. An
part4460.0
d here they are: Nitwit!
Blubber! Oddme
part4461.0
nt! Tweak!

"Thank you!"

He sat back d
part4462.0
own. Everybody clapped and cheered. Har
part4463.0
ry didn't know
whether to laugh or not.
part4464.0


"Is he -- a bit mad?" he asked Percy 
part4465.0
uncertainly.

"Mad?" said Percy airily.
part4466.0
 "He's a genius! Best wizard in the wor
part4467.0
ld! But
he is a bit mad, yes. Potatoes,
part4468.0
 Harry?"

Harry's mouth fell open. The 
part4469.0
dishes in front of him were now piled w
part4470.0
ith
food. He had never seen so many thi
part4471.0
ngs he liked to eat on one table:
roast
part4472.0
 beef, roast chicken, pork chops and la
part4473.0
mb chops, sausages, bacon
and steak, bo
part4474.0
iled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Y
part4475.0
orkshire pudding,
peas, carrots, gravy,
part4476.0
 ketchup, and, for some strange reason,
part4477.0
 peppermint
humbugs.

The Dursleys had 
part4478.0
never exactly starved Harry, but he'd n
part4479.0
ever been
allowed to eat as much as he 
part4480.0
liked. Dudley had always taken anything
part4481.0

that Harry really wanted, even if It m
part4482.0
ade him sick. Harry piled his
plate wit
part4483.0
h a bit of everything except the pepper
part4484.0
mints and began to eat.
It was all deli
part4485.0
cious.

"That does look good," said the
part4486.0
 ghost in the ruff sadly, watching Harr
part4487.0
y
cut up his steak,

"Can't you --?"

I
part4488.0
 haven't eaten for nearly four hundred 
part4489.0
years," said the ghost. "I don't
need t
part4490.0
o, of course, but one does miss it. I d
part4491.0
on't think I've in troduced
myself? Sir
part4492.0
 Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington at your s
part4493.0
ervice. Resident ghost
of Gryffindor To
part4494.0
wer."

"I know who you are!" said Ron s
part4495.0
uddenly. "My brothers told me about you
part4496.0

-- you're Nearly Headless Nick!"

"I w
part4497.0
ould prefer you to call me Sir Nicholas
part4498.0
 de Mimsy --" the ghost began
stiffly, 
part4499.0
but sandy-haired Seamus Finnigan interr
part4500.0
upted.

"Nearly Headless? How can you b
part4501.0
e nearly headless?"

Sir Nicholas looke
part4502.0
d extremely miffed, as if their little 
part4503.0
chat wasn't
going at all the way he wan
part4504.0
ted.

"Like this," he said irritably. H
part4505.0
e seized his left ear and pulled. His
w
part4506.0
hole head swung off his neck and fell o
part4507.0
nto his shoulder as if it was on
a hing
part4508.0
e. Someone had obviously tried to behea
part4509.0
d him, but not done it
properly. Lookin
part4510.0
g pleased at the stunned looks on their
part4511.0
 faces, Nearly
Headless Nick flipped hi
part4512.0
s head back onto his neck, coughed, and
part4513.0
 said,
"So -- new Gryffindors! I hope y
part4514.0
ou're going to help us win the house
ch
part4515.0
ampionship this year? Gryffindors have 
part4516.0
never gone so long without
winning. Sly
part4517.0
therins have got the cup six years in a
part4518.0
 row! The Bloody
Baron's becoming almos
part4519.0
t unbearable -- he's the Slytherin ghos
part4520.0
t."

Harry looked over at the Slytherin
part4521.0
 table and saw a horrible ghost
sitting
part4522.0
 there, with blank staring eyes, a gaun
part4523.0
t face, and robes stained
with silver b
part4524.0
lood. He was right next to Malfoy who, 
part4525.0
Harry was pleased to
see, didn't look t
part4526.0
oo pleased with the seating arrangement
part4527.0
s.

"How did he get covered in blood?" 
part4528.0
asked Seamus with great interest.

"I'v
part4529.0
e never asked," said Nearly Headless Ni
part4530.0
ck delicately.

When everyone had eaten
part4531.0
 as much as they could, the remains of 
part4532.0
the food
faded from the plates, leaving
part4533.0
 them sparkling clean as before. A mome
part4534.0
nt
later the desserts appeared. Blocks 
part4535.0
of ice cream in every flavor you
could 
part4536.0
think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, ch
part4537.0
ocolate eclairs and jam
doughnuts, trif
part4538.0
le, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding 
part4539.0
-- "

As Harry helped himself to a trea
part4540.0
cle tart, the talk turned to their
fami
part4541.0
lies.

"I'm half-and-half," said Seamus
part4542.0
. "Me dad's a Muggle. Mom didn't tell
h
part4543.0
im she was a witch 'til after they were
part4544.0
 married. Bit of a nasty shock
for him.
part4545.0
"

The others laughed.

"What about you
part4546.0
, Neville?" said Ron.

"Well, my gran b
part4547.0
rought me up and she's a witch," said N
part4548.0
eville, "but the
family thought I was a
part4549.0
ll- Muggle for ages. My Great Uncle Alg
part4550.0
ie kept
trying to catch me off my guard
part4551.0
 and force some magic out of me -- he
p
part4552.0
ushed me off the end of Blackpool pier 
part4553.0
once, I nearly drowned -- but
nothing h
part4554.0
appened until I was eight. Great Uncle 
part4555.0
Algie came round for
dinner, and he was
part4556.0
 hanging me out of an upstairs window b
part4557.0
y the ankles
when my Great Auntie Enid 
part4558.0
offered him a meringue and he accidenta
part4559.0
lly let
go. But I bounced -- all the wa
part4560.0
y down the garden and into the road. Th
part4561.0
ey
were all really pleased, Gran was cr
part4562.0
ying, she was so happy. And you
should 
part4563.0
have seen their faces when I got in her
part4564.0
e -- they thought I might
not be magic 
part4565.0
enough to come, you see. Great Uncle Al
part4566.0
gie was so pleased
he bought me my toad
part4567.0
."

On Harry's other side, Percy Weasle
part4568.0
y and Hermione were talking about
lesso
part4569.0
ns ("I do hope they start right away, t
part4570.0
here's so much to learn, I'm
particular
part4571.0
ly interested in Transfiguration, you k
part4572.0
now, turning something
into something e
part4573.0
lse, of course, it's supposed to be ver
part4574.0
y difficult-";
"You'll be starting smal
part4575.0
l, just matches into needles and that s
part4576.0
ort of
thing -- ").

Harry, who was sta
part4577.0
rting to feel warm and sleepy, looked u
part4578.0
p at

the High Table again. Hagrid was 
part4579.0
drinking deeply from his goblet.
Profes
part4580.0
sor McGonagall was talking to Professor
part4581.0
 Dumbledore. Professor
Quirrell, in his
part4582.0
 absurd turban, was talking to a teache
part4583.0
r with greasy
black hair, a hooked nose
part4584.0
, and sallow skin.

It happened very su
part4585.0
ddenly. The hook-nosed teacher looked p
part4586.0
ast Quirrell's
turban straight into Har
part4587.0
ry's eyes -- and a sharp, hot pain shot
part4588.0
 across
the scar on Harry's forehead.


part4589.0
"Ouch!" Harry clapped a hand to his hea
part4590.0
d.

"What is it?" asked Percy.

"N-noth
part4591.0
ing."

The pain had gone as quickly as 
part4592.0
it had come. Harder to shake off was th
part4593.0
e
feeling Harry had gotten from the tea
part4594.0
cher's look -- a feeling that he
didn't
part4595.0
 like Harry at all.

"Who's that teache
part4596.0
r talking to Professor Quirrell?" he as
part4597.0
ked Percy.

"Oh, you know Quirrell alre
part4598.0
ady, do you? No wonder he's looking so

part4599.0
nervous, that's Professor Snape. He tea
part4600.0
ches Potions, but he doesn't want
to --
part4601.0
 everyone knows he's after Quirrell's j
part4602.0
ob. Knows an awful lot about
the Dark A
part4603.0
rts, Snape."

Harry watched Snape for a
part4604.0
 while, but Snape didn't look at him ag
part4605.0
ain.

At last, the desserts too disappe
part4606.0
ared, and Professor Dumbledore got to
h
part4607.0
is feet again. The hall fell silent.

"
part4608.0
Ahern -- just a few more words now that
part4609.0
 we are all fed and watered. I
have a f
part4610.0
ew start-of-term notices to give you.


part4611.0
"First years should note that the fores
part4612.0
t on the grounds is forbidden to
all pu
part4613.0
pils. And a few of our older students w
part4614.0
ould do well to remember
that as well."
part4615.0


Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed i
part4616.0
n the direction of the Weasley
twins.


part4617.0
"I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, t
part4618.0
he caretaker, to remind you all
that no
part4619.0
 magic should be used between classes i
part4620.0
n the corridors.

"Quidditch trials wil
part4621.0
l be held in the second week of the ter
part4622.0
m. Anyone
interested in playing for the
part4623.0
ir house teams should contact Madam Hoo
part4624.0
ch.

"And finally, I must tell you that
part4625.0
 this year, the third-floor corridor
on
part4626.0
 the right-hand side is out of bounds t
part4627.0
o everyone who does not wish to
die a v
part4628.0
ery painful death."

Harry laughed, but
part4629.0
 he was one of the few who did.

"He's 
part4630.0
not serious?" he muttered to Percy.

"M
part4631.0
ust be," said Percy, frowning at Dumble
part4632.0
dore. "It's odd, because he
usually giv
part4633.0
es us a reason why we're not allowed to
part4634.0
 go somewhere -- the
forest's full of d
part4635.0
angerous beasts, everyone knows that. I
part4636.0
 do think he
might have told us prefect
part4637.0
s, at least."

"And now, before we go t
part4638.0
o bed, let us sing the school song!" cr
part4639.0
ied
Dumbledore. Harry noticed that the 
part4640.0
other teachers' smiles had become
rathe
part4641.0
r fixed.

Dumbledore gave his wand a li
part4642.0
ttle flick, as if he was trying to get 
part4643.0
a
fly off the end, and a long golden ri
part4644.0
bbon flew out of it, which rose
high ab
part4645.0
ove the tables and twisted itself, snak
part4646.0
elike, into words.

"Everyone pick thei
part4647.0
r favorite tune," said Dumbledore, "and
part4648.0
 off we go!"
And the school bellowed:


part4649.0
"Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwar
part4650.0
ts,

Teach us something please,

Whethe
part4651.0
r we be old and bald

Or young with sca
part4652.0
bby knees,

Our heads could do with fil
part4653.0
ling

With some interesting stuff,

For
part4654.0
 now they're bare and full of air,

Dea
part4655.0
d flies and bits of fluff,

So teach us
part4656.0
 things worth knowing,

Bring back what
part4657.0
 we've forgot,

just do your best, we'l
part4658.0
l do the rest,

And learn until our bra
part4659.0
ins all rot.

Everybody finished the so
part4660.0
ng at different times. At last, only th
part4661.0
e
Weasley twins were left singing along
part4662.0
 to a very slow funeral march.
Dumbledo
part4663.0
re conducted their last few lines with 
part4664.0
his wand and when they
had finished, he
part4665.0
 was one of those who clapped loudest.

part4666.0

"Ah, music," he said, wiping his eyes.
part4667.0
 "A magic beyond all we do here!
And no
part4668.0
w, bedtime. Off you trot!"

The Gryffin
part4669.0
dor first years followed Percy through 
part4670.0
the chattering crowds,
out of the Great
part4671.0
 Hall, and up the marble staircase. Har
part4672.0
ry's legs were
like lead again, but onl
part4673.0
y because he was so tired and full of f
part4674.0
ood. He
was too sleepy even to be surpr
part4675.0
ised that the people in the portraits
a
part4676.0
long the corridors whispered and pointe
part4677.0
d as they passed, or that twice
Percy l
part4678.0
ed them through doorways hidden behind 
part4679.0
sliding panels and hanging
tapestries. 
part4680.0
They climbed more staircases, yawning a
part4681.0
nd dragging their
feet, and Harry was j
part4682.0
ust wondering how much farther they had
part4683.0
 to go when
they came to a sudden halt.
part4684.0


A bundle of walking sticks was floati
part4685.0
ng in midair ahead of them, and as
Perc
part4686.0
y took a step toward them they started 
part4687.0
throwing themselves at him.

"Peeves," 
part4688.0
Percy whispered to the first years. "A 
part4689.0
poltergeist." He raised
his voice, "Pee
part4690.0
ves -- show yourself"

A loud, rude sou
part4691.0
nd, like the air being let out of a bal
part4692.0
loon, answered.

"Do you want me to go 
part4693.0
to the Bloody Baron?"

There was a pop,
part4694.0
 and a little man with wicked, dark eye
part4695.0
s and a wide
mouth appeared, floating c
part4696.0
ross- legged in the air, clutching the 
part4697.0
walking
sticks.

"Oooooooh!" he said, w
part4698.0
ith an evil cackle. "Ickle Firsties! Wh
part4699.0
at fun!"

He swooped suddenly at them. 
part4700.0
They all ducked.

"Go away, Peeves, or 
part4701.0
the Baron'll hear about this, I mean it
part4702.0
!" barked
Percy.

Peeves stuck out his 
part4703.0
tongue and vanished, dropping the walki
part4704.0
ng sticks on
Neville's head. They heard
part4705.0
 him zooming away, rattling coats of ar
part4706.0
mor as
he passed.

"You want to watch o
part4707.0
ut for Peeves," said Percy, as they set
part4708.0
 off again.
"The Bloody Baron's the onl
part4709.0
y one who can control him, he won't eve
part4710.0
n
listen to us prefects. Here we are."

part4711.0

At the very end of the corridor hung a
part4712.0
 portrait of a very fat woman in a
pink
part4713.0
 silk dress.

"Password?" she said. "Ca
part4714.0
put Draconis," said Percy, and the port
part4715.0
rait
swung forward to reveal a round ho
part4716.0
le in the wall. They all scrambled
thro
part4717.0
ugh it -- Neville needed a leg up -- an
part4718.0
d found themselves in the
Gryffindor co
part4719.0
mmon room, a cozy, round room full of s
part4720.0
quashy armchairs.

Percy directed the g
part4721.0
irls through one door to their dormitor
part4722.0
y and the
boys through another. At the 
part4723.0
top of a spiral staircase -- they were

part4724.0
obviously in one of the towers -- they 
part4725.0
found their beds at last: five
four-pos
part4726.0
ters hung with deep red, velvet curtain
part4727.0
s. Their trunks had
already been brough
part4728.0
t up. Too tired to talk much, they pull
part4729.0
ed on their
pajamas and fell into bed.

part4730.0

" Great food, isn't it?" Ron muttered 
part4731.0
to Harry through the hangings.
"Get off
part4732.0
, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets."

H
part4733.0
arry was going to ask Ron if he'd had a
part4734.0
ny of the treacle tart, but he
fell asl
part4735.0
eep almost at once.

Perhaps Harry had 
part4736.0
eaten a bit too much, because he had a 
part4737.0
very strange
dream. He was wearing Prof
part4738.0
essor Quirrell's turban, which kept tal
part4739.0
king to
him, telling him he must transf
part4740.0
er to Slytherin at once, because it was
part4741.0

his destiny. Harry told the turban he 
part4742.0
didn't want to be in Slytherin; it
got 
part4743.0
heavier and heavier; he tried to pull i
part4744.0
t off but it tightened
painfully -- and
part4745.0
 there was Malfoy, laughing at him as h
part4746.0
e struggled with
it -then Malfoy turned
part4747.0
 into the hook-nosed teacher, Snape, wh
part4748.0
ose laugh
became high and cold -- there
part4749.0
 was a burst of green light and Harry w
part4750.0
oke,
sweating and shaking.

He rolled o
part4751.0
ver and fell asleep again, and when he 
part4752.0
woke next day, he
didn't remember the d
part4753.0
ream at all.

There, look."

"Where?"

"Ne

xt to the tall kid with the red hair."

part4756.0

"Wearing the glasses?"

"Did you see h
part4757.0
is face?"

"Did you see his scar?"

Whi
part4758.0
spers followed Harry from the moment he
part4759.0
 left his dormitory the next
day. Peopl
part4760.0
e lining up outside classrooms stood on
part4761.0
 tiptoe to get a look
at him, or double
part4762.0
d back to pass him in the corridors aga
part4763.0
in, staring.
Harry wished they wouldn't
part4764.0
, because he was trying to concentrate 
part4765.0
on
finding his way to classes.

There w
part4766.0
ere a hundred and forty-two staircases 
part4767.0
at Hogwarts: wide,
sweeping ones; narro
part4768.0
w, rickety ones; some that led somewher
part4769.0
e different
on a Friday; some with a va
part4770.0

part4771.0

remember to jump. Then there were door
part4772.0
s that wouldn't open unless you
asked p
part4773.0
olitely, or tickled them in exactly the
part4774.0
 right place, and doors
that weren't re
part4775.0
ally doors at all, but solid walls just
part4776.0
 pretending. It
was also very hard to r
part4777.0
emember where anything was, because it 
part4778.0
all seemed
to move around a lot. The pe
part4779.0
ople in the portraits kept going to vis
part4780.0
it
each other, and Harry was sure the c
part4781.0
oats of armor could walk.

The ghosts d
part4782.0
idn't help, either. It was always a nas
part4783.0
ty shock when one of
them glided sudden
part4784.0
ly through a door you were trying to op
part4785.0
en. Nearly
Headless Nick was always hap
part4786.0
py to point new Gryffindors in the righ
part4787.0
t
direction, but Peeves the Poltergeist
part4788.0
 was worth two locked doors and a
trick
part4789.0
 staircase if you met him when you were
part4790.0
 late for class. He would
drop wastepap
part4791.0
er baskets on your head, pull rugs from
part4792.0
 under your feet,
pelt you with bits of
part4793.0
 chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisib
part4794.0
le, grab
your nose, and screech, "GOT Y
part4795.0
OUR CONK!"

Even worse than Peeves, if 
part4796.0
that was possible, was the caretaker, A
part4797.0
rgus
Filch. Harry and Ron managed to ge
part4798.0
t on the wrong side of him on their
ver
part4799.0
y first morning. Filch found them tryin
part4800.0
g to force their way through a
door tha
part4801.0
t unluckily turned out to be the entran
part4802.0
ce to the out-of-bounds
corridor on the
part4803.0
 third floor. He wouldn't believe they 
part4804.0
were lost, was
sure they were trying to
part4805.0
 break into it on purpose, and was thre
part4806.0
atening
to lock them in the dungeons wh
part4807.0
en they were rescued by Professor
Quirr
part4808.0
ell, who was passing.

Filch owned a ca
part4809.0
t called Mrs. Norris, a scrawny, dust-c
part4810.0
olored creature
with bulging, lamp like
part4811.0
 eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled 
part4812.0
the
corridors alone. Break a rule in fr
part4813.0
ont of her, put just one toe out of
lin
part4814.0
e, and she'd whisk off for Filch, who'd
part4815.0
 appear, wheezing, two seconds
later. F
part4816.0
ilch knew the secret passageways of the
part4817.0
 school better than
anyone (except perh
part4818.0
aps the Weasley twins) and could pop up
part4819.0
 as suddenly
as any of the ghosts. The 
part4820.0
students all hated him, and it was the 
part4821.0
dearest
ambition of many to give Mrs. N
part4822.0
orris a good kick.

And then, once you 
part4823.0
had managed to find them, there were th
part4824.0
e classes
themselves. There was a lot m
part4825.0
ore to magic, as Harry quickly found ou
part4826.0
t,
than waving your wand and saying a f
part4827.0
ew funny words.

They had to study the 
part4828.0
night skies through their telescopes ev
part4829.0
ery
Wednesday at midnight and learn the
part4830.0
 names of different stars and the
movem
part4831.0
ents of the planets. Three times a week
part4832.0
 they went out to the
greenhouses behin
part4833.0
d the castle to study Herbology, with a
part4834.0
 dumpy little
witch called Professor Sp
part4835.0
rout, where they learned how to take ca
part4836.0
re of
all the strange plants and fungi,
part4837.0
 and found out what they were used for.
part4838.0


Easily the most boring class was Hist
part4839.0
ory of Magic, which was the only
one ta
part4840.0
ught by a ghost. Professor Binns had be
part4841.0
en very old

indeed when he had fallen 
part4842.0
asleep in front of the staff room fire 
part4843.0
and got
up next morning to teach, leavi
part4844.0
ng his body behind him. Binns droned on
part4845.0

and on while they scribbled down names
part4846.0
 and dates, and got Emetic the
Evil and
part4847.0
 Uric the Oddball mixed up.

Professor 
part4848.0
Flitwick, the Charms teacher, was a tin
part4849.0
y little wizard who had
to stand on a p
part4850.0
ile of books to see over his desk. At t
part4851.0
he start of their
first class he took t
part4852.0
he roll call, and when he reached Harry
part4853.0
's name he
gave an excited squeak and t
part4854.0
oppled out of sight.

Professor McGonag
part4855.0
all was again different. Harry had been
part4856.0
 quite right to
think she wasn't a teac
part4857.0
her to cross. Strict and clever, she ga
part4858.0
ve them a
talking-to the moment they sa
part4859.0
t down in her first class.

"Transfigur
part4860.0
ation is some of the most complex and d
part4861.0
angerous magic you
will learn at Hogwar
part4862.0
ts," she said. "Anyone messing around i
part4863.0
n my class
will leave and not come back
part4864.0
. You have been warned."

Then she chan
part4865.0
ged her desk into a pig and back again.
part4866.0
 They were all very
impressed and could
part4867.0
n't wait to get started, but soon reali
part4868.0
zed they
weren't going to be changing t
part4869.0
he furniture into animals for a long ti
part4870.0
me.
After taking a lot of complicated n
part4871.0
otes, they were each given a match
and 
part4872.0
started trying to turn it into a needle
part4873.0
. By the end of the lesson,
only Hermio
part4874.0
ne Granger had made any difference to h
part4875.0
er match; Professor
McGonagall showed t
part4876.0
he class how it had gone all silver and
part4877.0
 pointy and
gave Hermione a rare smile.
part4878.0


The class everyone had really been lo
part4879.0
oking forward to was Defense
Against th
part4880.0
e Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons tur
part4881.0
ned out to be a bit of
a joke. His clas
part4882.0
sroom smelled strongly of garlic, which
part4883.0
 everyone said
was to ward off a vampir
part4884.0
e he'd met in Romania and was afraid wo
part4885.0
uld be
coming back to get him one of th
part4886.0
ese days. His turban, he told them, had
part4887.0

been given to him by an African prince
part4888.0
 as a thank-you for getting rid of
a tr
part4889.0
oublesome zombie, but they weren't sure
part4890.0
 they believed this story.
For one thin
part4891.0
g, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly t
part4892.0
o hear how Quirrell
had fought off the 
part4893.0
zombie, Quirrell went pink and started 
part4894.0
talking about
the weather; for another,
part4895.0
 they had noticed that a funny smell hu
part4896.0
ng
around the turban, and the Weasley t
part4897.0
wins insisted that it was stuffed
full 
part4898.0
of garlic as well, so that Quirrell was
part4899.0
 protected wherever he went.

Harry was
part4900.0
 very relieved to find out that he wasn
part4901.0
't miles behind everyone
else. Lots of 
part4902.0
people had come from Muggle families an
part4903.0
d, like him, hadn't
had any idea that t
part4904.0
hey were witches and wizards. There was
part4905.0
 so much to
learn that even people like
part4906.0
 Ron didn't have much of a head start.

part4907.0

Friday was an important day for Harry 
part4908.0
and Ron. They finally managed to
find t
part4909.0
heir way down to the Great Hall for bre
part4910.0
akfast without getting lost
once.

"Wha
part4911.0
t have we got today?" Harry asked Ron a
part4912.0
s he poured sugar on his
porridge.

"Do
part4913.0
uble Potions with the Slytherins," said
part4914.0
 Ron. "Snape's Head of
Slytherin House.
part4915.0
 They say he always favors them -- we'l
part4916.0
l be able to see
if it's true."

"Wish 
part4917.0
McGonagall favored us, " said Harry. Pr
part4918.0
ofessor McGonagall was head
of Gryffind
part4919.0
or House, but it hadn't stopped her fro
part4920.0
m giving them a huge
pile of homework t
part4921.0
he day before.

Just then, the mail arr
part4922.0
ived. Harry had gotten used to this by 
part4923.0
now, but
it had given him a bit of a sh
part4924.0
ock on the first morning, when about a

part4925.0
hundred owls had suddenly streamed into
part4926.0
 the Great Hall during breakfast,
circl
part4927.0
ing the tables until they saw their own
part4928.0
ers, and dropping letters
and packages 
part4929.0
onto their laps.

Hedwig hadn't brought
part4930.0
 Harry anything so far. She sometimes f
part4931.0
lew in to
nibble his ear and have a bit
part4932.0
 of toast before going off to sleep in 
part4933.0
the
owlery with the other school owls. 
part4934.0
This morning, however, she fluttered
do
part4935.0
wn between the marmalade and the sugar 
part4936.0
bowl and dropped a note onto
Harry's pl
part4937.0
ate. Harry tore it open at once. It sai
part4938.0
d, in a very untidy
scrawl:


Dear Harr
part4939.0
y,

I know you get Friday afternoons of
part4940.0
f, so would you like to come and have
a
part4941.0
 cup of tea with me around three?

I wa
part4942.0
nt to hear all about your first week. S
part4943.0
end us an answer back with
Hedwig.

Hag
part4944.0
rid


Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scrib
part4945.0
bled Yes, please, see you later on the

part4946.0
back of the note, and sent Hedwig off a
part4947.0
gain.

It was lucky that Harry had tea 
part4948.0
with Hagrid to look forward to, because
part4949.0

the Potions lesson turned out to be th
part4950.0
e worst thing that had happened to
him 
part4951.0
so far.

At the start-of-term banquet, 
part4952.0
Harry had gotten the idea that Professo
part4953.0
r
Snape disliked him. By the end of the
part4954.0
 first Potions lesson, he knew he'd
bee
part4955.0
n wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry -- 
part4956.0
he hated him.

Potions lessons took pla
part4957.0
ce down in one of the dungeons. It was 
part4958.0
colder
here than up in the main castle,
part4959.0
 and would have been quite creepy enoug
part4960.0
h
without the pickled animals floating 
part4961.0
in glass jars all around the walls.

Sn
part4962.0
ape, like Flitwick, started the class b
part4963.0
y taking the roll call, and
like Flitwi
part4964.0
ck, he paused at Harry's name.

"Ah, Ye
part4965.0
s," he said softly, "Harry Potter. Our 
part4966.0
new -- celebrity."

Draco Malfoy and hi
part4967.0
s friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered be
part4968.0
hind their
hands. Snape finished callin
part4969.0
g the names and looked up at the class.
part4970.0
 His
eyes were black like Hagrid's, but
part4971.0
 they had none of Hagrid's warmth.
They
part4972.0
 were cold and empty and made you think
part4973.0
 of dark tunnels.

"You are here to lea
part4974.0
rn the subtle science and exact art of

part4975.0
potionmaking," he began. He spoke in ba
part4976.0
rely more than a whisper, but
they caug
part4977.0
ht every word -- like Professor McGonag
part4978.0
all, Snape had y caught
every word -- l
part4979.0
ike Professor McGonagall, Snape had the
part4980.0
 gift of keeping a
class silent without
part4981.0
 effort. "As there is little foolish wa
part4982.0
nd-waving
here, many of you will hardly
part4983.0
 believe this is magic. I don't expect 
part4984.0
you
will really understand the beauty o
part4985.0
f the softly simmering cauldron with
it
part4986.0
s shimmering fumes, the delicate power 
part4987.0
of liquids that creep through
human vei
part4988.0
ns, bewitching the mind, ensnaring the 
part4989.0
senses.... I can teach
you how to bottl
part4990.0
e fame, brew glory, even stopper death 
part4991.0
-- if you aren't
as big a bunch of dund
part4992.0
erheads as I usually have to teach."

M
part4993.0
ore silence followed this little speech
part4994.0
. Harry and Ron exchanged looks
with ra
part4995.0
ised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was on 
part4996.0
the edge of her seat and
looked despera
part4997.0
te to start proving that she wasn't a d
part4998.0
underhead.

"Potter!" said Snape sudden
part4999.0
ly. "What would I get if I added powder
part5000.0
ed
root of asphodel to an infusion of w
part5001.0
ormwood?"

Powdered root of what to an 
part5002.0
infusion of what? Harry glanced at Ron,
part5003.0
 who
looked as stumped as he was; Hermi
part5004.0
one's hand had shot into the air.

"I d
part5005.0
on't know, sit," said Harry.

Snape's l
part5006.0
ips curled into a sneer.

"Tut, tut -- 
part5007.0
fame clearly isn't everything."

He ign
part5008.0
ored Hermione's hand.

"Let's try again
part5009.0
. Potter, where would you look if I tol
part5010.0
d you to find me
a bezoar?"

Hermione s
part5011.0
tretched her hand as high into the air 
part5012.0
as it would go without
her leaving her 
part5013.0
seat, but Harry didn't have the faintes
part5014.0
t idea what a
bezoar was. He tried not 
part5015.0
to look at Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, w
part5016.0
ho were
shaking with laughter.

"I don'
part5017.0
t know, sit." "Thought you wouldn't ope
part5018.0
n a book before coming,
eh, Potter?" Ha
part5019.0
rry forced himself to keep looking stra
part5020.0
ight into those
cold eyes. He had looke
part5021.0
d through his books at the Dursleys', b
part5022.0
ut did
Snape expect him to remember eve
part5023.0
rything in One Thousand Magical Herbs
a
part5024.0
nd Fungi?

Snape was still ignoring Her
part5025.0
mione's quivering hand.

"What is the d
part5026.0
ifference, Potter, between monkshood an
part5027.0
d wolfsbane?"

At this, Hermione stood 
part5028.0
up, her hand stretching toward the dung
part5029.0
eon
ceiling.

"I don't know," said Harr
part5030.0
y quietly. "I think Hermione does, thou
part5031.0
gh, why
don't you try her?"

A few peop
part5032.0
le laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, 
part5033.0
and Seamus winked.
Snape, however, was 
part5034.0
not pleased.

"Sit down," he snapped at
part5035.0
 Hermione. "For your information, Potte
part5036.0
r,
asphodel and wormwood make a sleepin
part5037.0
g potion so powerful it is known as
the
part5038.0
 Draught of Living Death. A bezoar is a
part5039.0
 stone taken from the stomach
of a goat
part5040.0
 and it will save you from most poisons
part5041.0
. As for monkshood and
wolfsbane, they 
part5042.0
are the same plant, which also goes by 
part5043.0
the name of
aconite. Well? Why aren't y
part5044.0
ou all copying that down?"

There was a
part5045.0
 sudden rummaging for quills and parchm
part5046.0
ent. Over the noise,
Snape said, "And a
part5047.0
 point will be taken from Gryffindor Ho
part5048.0
use for your
cheek, Potter."

Things di
part5049.0
dn't improve for the Gryffindors as the
part5050.0
 Potions lesson
continued. Snape put th
part5051.0
em all into pairs and set them to mixin
part5052.0
g up a
simple potion to cure boils. He 
part5053.0
swept around in his long black cloak,
w
part5054.0
atching them weigh dried nettles and cr
part5055.0
ush snake fangs, criticizing
almost eve
part5056.0
ryone except Malfoy, whom he seemed to 
part5057.0
like. He was just
telling everyone to l
part5058.0
ook at the perfect way Malfoy had stewe
part5059.0
d his horned
slugs when clouds of acid 
part5060.0
green smoke and a loud hissing filled t
part5061.0
he
dungeon. Neville had somehow managed
part5062.0
 to melt Seamus's cauldron into a
twist
part5063.0
ed blob, and their potion was seeping a
part5064.0
cross the stone floor,
burning holes in
part5065.0
 people's shoes. Within seconds, the wh
part5066.0
ole class was
standing on their stools 
part5067.0
while Neville, who had been drenched in
part5068.0
 the
potion when the cauldron collapsed
part5069.0
, moaned in pain as angry red boils
spr
part5070.0
ang up all over his arms and legs.

"Id
part5071.0
iot boy!" snarled Snape, clearing the s
part5072.0
pilled potion away with one
wave of his
part5073.0
 wand. "I suppose you added the porcupi
part5074.0
ne quills before
taking the cauldron of
part5075.0
f the fire?"

Neville whimpered as boil
part5076.0
s started to pop up all over his nose.

part5077.0

"Take him up to the hospital wing," Sn
part5078.0
ape spat at Seamus. Then he
rounded on 
part5079.0
Harry and Ron, who had been working nex
part5080.0
t to Neville.

"You -- Potter -- why di
part5081.0
dn't you tell him not to add the quills
part5082.0
? Thought
he'd make you look good if he
part5083.0
 got it wrong, did you? That's another

part5084.0
point you've lost for Gryffindor."

Thi
part5085.0
s was so unfair that Harry opened his m
part5086.0
outh to argue, but Ron kicked
him behin
part5087.0
d their cauldron.

"Doi* push it," he m
part5088.0
uttered, "I've heard Snape can turn ver
part5089.0
y nasty."

As they climbed the steps ou
part5090.0
t of the dungeon an hour later, Harry's
part5091.0
 mind
was racing and his spirits were l
part5092.0
ow. He'd lost two points for Gryffindor
part5093.0

in his very first week -- why did Snap
part5094.0
e hate him so much? "Cheer up,"
said Ro
part5095.0
n, "Snape's always taking points off Fr
part5096.0
ed and George. Can I come
and meet Hagr
part5097.0
id with you?"

At five to three they le
part5098.0
ft the castle and made their way across
part5099.0
 the
grounds. Hagrid lived in a small w
part5100.0
ooden house on the edge of the
forbidde
part5101.0
n forest. A crossbow and a pair of galo
part5102.0
shes were outside the
front door.

When
part5103.0
 Harry knocked they heard a frantic scr
part5104.0
abbling from inside and
several booming
part5105.0
 barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, s
part5106.0
aying, "Back, Fang
-- back."

Hagrid's 
part5107.0
big, hairy face appeared in the crack a
part5108.0
s he pulled the door
open.

"Hang on," 
part5109.0
he said. "Back, Fang."

He let them in,
part5110.0
 struggling to keep a hold on the colla
part5111.0
r of an enormous
black boarhound.

Ther
part5112.0
e was only one room inside. Hams and ph
part5113.0
easants were hanging from the
ceiling, 
part5114.0
a copper kettle was boiling on the open
part5115.0
 fire, and in the corner
stood a massiv
part5116.0
e bed with a patchwork quilt over it.


part5117.0
"Make yerselves at home," said Hagrid, 
part5118.0
letting go of Fang, who bounded
straigh
part5119.0
t at Ron and started licking his ears. 
part5120.0
Like Hagrid, Fang was
clearly not as fi
part5121.0
erce as he looked.

"This is Ron," Harr
part5122.0
y told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling 
part5123.0
water into a
large teapot and putting r
part5124.0
ock cakes onto a plate.

"Another Weasl
part5125.0
ey, eh?" said Hagrid, glancing at Ron's
part5126.0
 freckles. I spent
half me life chasin'
part5127.0
 yer twin brothers away from the forest
part5128.0
."

The rock cakes were shapeless lumps
part5129.0
 with raisins that almost broke their
t
part5130.0
eeth, but Harry and Ron pretended to be
part5131.0
 enjoying them as they told
Hagrid all 
part5132.0
about their first -lessons. Fang rested
part5133.0
 his head on Harry's
knee and drooled a
part5134.0
ll over his robes.

Harry and Ron were 
part5135.0
delighted to hear Hagrid call Fitch "th
part5136.0
at old git."

"An' as fer that cat, Mrs
part5137.0
. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her to
part5138.0
 Fang
sometime. D'yeh know, every time 
part5139.0
I go up ter the school, she follows me

part5140.0
everywhere? Can't get rid of her -- Fit
part5141.0
ch puts her up to it."

Harry told Hagr
part5142.0
id about Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like R
part5143.0
on, told Harry not
to worry about it, t
part5144.0
hat Snape liked hardly any of the stude
part5145.0
nts.

"But he seemed to really hate me.
part5146.0
"

"Rubbish!" said Hagrid. "Why should 
part5147.0
he?"

Yet Harry couldn't help thinking 
part5148.0
that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes

part5149.0
when he said that.

"How's yer brother 
part5150.0
Charlie?" Hagrid asked Ron. "I liked hi
part5151.0
m a lot --
great with animals."

Harry 
part5152.0
wondered if Hagrid had changed the subj
part5153.0
ect on purpose. While Ron
told Hagrid a
part5154.0
ll about Charlie's work with dragons, H
part5155.0
arry picked up a
piece of paper that wa
part5156.0
s lying on the table under the tea cozy
part5157.0
. It was a
cutting from the Daily Proph
part5158.0
et:

GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST

Investi
part5159.0
gations continue into the break-in at G
part5160.0
ringotts on 31 July,
widely believed to
part5161.0
 be the work of Dark wizards or witches
part5162.0
 unknown.

Gringotts goblins today insi
part5163.0
sted that nothing had been taken. The v
part5164.0
ault
that was searched had in fact been
part5165.0
 emptied the same day.

"But we're not 
part5166.0
telling you what was in there, so keep 
part5167.0
your noses out if
you know what's good 
part5168.0
for you," said a Gringotts spokesgoblin
part5169.0
 this
afternoon.

Harry remembered Ron 
part5170.0
telling him on the train that someone h
part5171.0
ad tried to
rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn
part5172.0
't mentioned the date.

"Hagrid!" said 
part5173.0
Harry, "that Gringotts break-in happene
part5174.0
d on my birthday!
It might've been happ
part5175.0
ening while we were there!"

There was 
part5176.0
no doubt about it, Hagrid definitely di
part5177.0
dn't meet Harry's eyes
this time. He gr
part5178.0
unted and offered him another rock cake
part5179.0
. Harry read the
story again. The vault
part5180.0
 that was searched had in fact been emp
part5181.0
tied
earlier that same day. Hagrid had 
part5182.0
emptied vault seven hundred and
thirtee
part5183.0
n, if you could call it emptying, takin
part5184.0
g out that grubby little
package. Had t
part5185.0
hat been what the thieves were looking 
part5186.0
for?

As Harry and Ron walked back to t
part5187.0
he castle for dinner, their pockets
wei
part5188.0
ghed down with rock cakes they'd been t
part5189.0
oo polite to refuse, Harry
thought that
part5190.0
 none of the lessons he'd had so far ha
part5191.0
d given him as much
to think about as t
part5192.0
ea with Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected th
part5193.0
at package
just in time? Where was it n
part5194.0
ow? And did Hagrid know something about
part5195.0

Snape that he didn't want to tell Harr
part5196.0
y?


CHAPTER NINE

THE MIDNIGHT DUEL

H
part5197.0
arry had never believed he would meet a
part5198.0
 boy he hated more than Dudley,
but tha
part5199.0
t was before he met Draco Malfoy.	Still
part5200.0
, first-year
Gryffindors only had Potio
part5201.0
ns with the Slytherins, so they didn't 
part5202.0
have to
put up with Malfoy much. Or at 
part5203.0
least, they didn't until they spotted a
part5204.0

notice pinned up in the Gryffindor com
part5205.0
mon room that made them all groan.
Flyi
part5206.0
ng lessons would be starting on Thursda
part5207.0
y -- and Gryffindor and
Slytherin	would
part5208.0
 be learning together.

"Typical," said
part5209.0
 Harry darkly. "Just what I always want
part5210.0
ed. To make a fool
of myself on a broom
part5211.0
stick in front of Malfoy."

He had been
part5212.0
 looking forward to learning to fly mor
part5213.0
e than anything else.

"You don't know 
part5214.0
that you'll make a fool of yourself," s
part5215.0
aid Ron
reasonably. "Anyway, I know Mal
part5216.0
foy's always going on about how good he
part5217.0

is at Quidditch, but I bet that's all 
part5218.0
talk."

Malfay certainly did talk about
part5219.0
 flying a lot. He complained loudly abo
part5220.0
ut
first years never getting on the hou
part5221.0
se Quidditch teams and told long,
boast
part5222.0
ful stories that always seemed to end w
part5223.0
ith him narrowly escaping
Muggles in he
part5224.0
licopters. He wasn't the only one, thou
part5225.0
gh: the way Seamus
Finnigan told it, he
part5226.0
'd spent most of his childhood zooming 
part5227.0
around the
countryside on his broomstic
part5228.0
k. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd lis
part5229.0
ten
about the time he'd almost hit a ha
part5230.0
ng glider on Charlie's old broom.
Every
part5231.0
one from wizarding families talked abou
part5232.0
t Quidditch constantly. Ron
had already
part5233.0
 had a big argument with Dean Thomas, w
part5234.0
ho shared their
dormitory, about soccer
part5235.0
. Ron couldn't see what was exciting ab
part5236.0
out a game
with only one ball where no 
part5237.0
one was allowed to fly. Harry had caugh
part5238.0
t Ron
prodding Dean's poster of West Ha
part5239.0
m soccer team, trying to make the
playe
part5240.0
rs move.

Neville had never been on a b
part5241.0
roomstick in his life, because his
gran
part5242.0
dmother had never let him near one. Pri
part5243.0
vately, Harry felt she'd had
good reaso
part5244.0
n, because Neville managed to have an e
part5245.0
xtraordinary number of
accidents even w
part5246.0
ith both feet on the ground.

Hermione 
part5247.0
Granger was almost as nervous about fly
part5248.0
ing as Neville was. This
was something 
part5249.0
you couldn't learn by heart out of a bo
part5250.0
ok -- not that she
hadn't tried. At bre
part5251.0
akfast on Thursday she bored them all s
part5252.0
tupid with
flying tips she'd gotten out
part5253.0
 of a library book called Quidditch Thr
part5254.0
ough
the Ages. Neville was hanging on t
part5255.0
o her every word, desperate for
anythin
part5256.0
g that might help him hang on to his br
part5257.0
oomstick later, but
everybody else was 
part5258.0
very pleased when Hermione's lecture wa
part5259.0
s interrupted
by the arrival of the mai
part5260.0
l.

Harry hadn't had a single letter si
part5261.0
nce Hagrid's note, something that
Malfo
part5262.0
y had been quick to notice, of course. 
part5263.0
Malfoy's eagle owl was
always bringing 
part5264.0
him packages of sweets from home, which
part5265.0
 he opened
gloatingly at the Slytherin 
part5266.0
table.

A barn owl brought Neville a sm
part5267.0
all package from his grandmother. He
op
part5268.0
ened it excitedly and showed them a gla
part5269.0
ss ball the size of a large
marble, whi
part5270.0
ch seemed to be full of white smoke.

"
part5271.0
It's a Remembrall!" he explained. "Gran
part5272.0
 knows I forget things -- this
tells yo
part5273.0
u if there's something you've forgotten
part5274.0
 to do. Look, you hold it
tight like th
part5275.0
is and if it turns red -- oh..." His fa
part5276.0
ce fell, because the
Remembrall had sud
part5277.0
denly glowed scarlet,

"You've forgotte
part5278.0
n something..."

Neville was trying to 
part5279.0
remember what he'd forgotten when Draco
part5280.0
 Malfoy,
who was passing the Gryffindor
part5281.0
 table, snatched the Remembrall out of 
part5282.0
his
hand.

Harry and Ron jumped to thei
part5283.0
r feet. They were half hoping for a rea
part5284.0
son
to fight Malfay, but Professor McGo
part5285.0
nagall, who could spot trouble
quicker 
part5286.0
than any teacher in the school, was the
part5287.0
re in a flash.

"What's going on?"

"Ma
part5288.0
lfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor."


part5289.0
Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped the Re
part5290.0
membrall back on the table.

"Just look
part5291.0
ing," he said, and he sloped away with 
part5292.0
Crabbe and Goyle behind
him.

At three-
part5293.0
thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and 
part5294.0
the other Gryffindors
hurried down the 
part5295.0
front steps onto the grounds for their 
part5296.0
first flying
lesson. It was a clear, br
part5297.0
eezy day, and the grass rippled under t
part5298.0
heir
feet as they marched down the slop
part5299.0
ing lawns toward a smooth, flat lawn
on
part5300.0
 the opposite side of the grounds to th
part5301.0
e forbidden forest, whose trees
were sw
part5302.0
aying darkly in the distance.

The Slyt
part5303.0
herins were already there, and so were 
part5304.0
twenty broomsticks lying
in neat lines 
part5305.0
on the ground. Harry had heard Fred and
part5306.0
 George Weasley
complain about the scho
part5307.0
ol brooms, saying that some of them sta
part5308.0
rted to
vibrate if you flew too high, o
part5309.0
r always flew slightly to the left.

Th
part5310.0
eir teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She 
part5311.0
had short, gray hair, and
yellow eyes l
part5312.0
ike a hawk.

"Well, what are you all wa
part5313.0
iting for?" she barked. "Everyone stand
part5314.0
 by a
broomstick. Come on, hurry up."


part5315.0
Harry glanced down at his broom. It was
part5316.0
 old and some of the twigs stuck
out at
part5317.0
 odd angles.

"Stick out your right han
part5318.0
d over your broom," called Madam Hooch 
part5319.0
at the
front, "and say 'Up!"'

"UPF eve
part5320.0
ryone shouted.

Harry's broom jumped in
part5321.0
to his hand at once, but it was one of 
part5322.0
the few
that did. Hermione Granger's ha
part5323.0
d simply rolled over on the ground, and
part5324.0

Neville's hadn't moved at all. Perhaps
part5325.0
 brooms, like horses, could tell
when y
part5326.0
ou were afraid, thought Harry; there wa
part5327.0
s a quaver in Neville's
voice that said
part5328.0
 only too clearly that he wanted to kee
part5329.0
p his feet on the
ground.

Madam Hooch 
part5330.0
then showed them how to mount their bro
part5331.0
oms without sliding
off the end, and wa
part5332.0
lked up and down the rows correcting th
part5333.0
eir grips.
Harry and Ron were delighted
part5334.0
 when she told Malfoy he'd been doing i
part5335.0
t
wrong for years.

"Now, when I blow m
part5336.0
y whistle, you kick off from the ground
part5337.0
, hard," said
Madam Hooch. "Keep your b
part5338.0
rooms steady, rise a few feet, and then
part5339.0
 come
straight back down by leaning for
part5340.0
ward slightly. On my whistle -- three
-
part5341.0
- two --"

But Neville, nervous and jum
part5342.0
py and frightened of being left on the

part5343.0
ground, pushed off hard before the whis
part5344.0
tle had touched Madam Hooch's
lips.

"C
part5345.0
ome back, boy!" she shouted, but Nevill
part5346.0
e was rising straight up like a
cork sh
part5347.0
ot out of a bottle -- twelve feet -- tw
part5348.0
enty feet. Harry saw his
scared white f
part5349.0
ace look down at the ground falling awa
part5350.0
y, saw him gasp,
slip sideways off the 
part5351.0
broom and --

WHAM -- a thud and a nast
part5352.0
y crack and Neville lay facedown on the
part5353.0
 grass
in a heap. His broomstick was st
part5354.0
ill rising higher and higher, and
start
part5355.0
ed to drift lazily toward the forbidden
part5356.0
 forest and out of sight.

Madam Hooch 
part5357.0
was bending over Neville, her face as w
part5358.0
hite as his.

"Broken wrist," Harry hea
part5359.0
rd her mutter. "Come on, boy -- it's al
part5360.0
l right,
up you get.".

She turned to t
part5361.0
he rest of the class.

"None of you is 
part5362.0
to move while I take this boy to the ho
part5363.0
spital wing! You
leave those brooms whe
part5364.0
re they are or you'll be out of Hogwart
part5365.0
s before
you can say 'Quidditch.' Come 
part5366.0
on, dear."

Neville, his face tear-stre
part5367.0
aked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off 
part5368.0
with
Madam Hooch, who had her arm aroun
part5369.0
d him.

No sooner were they out of ears
part5370.0
hot than Malfoy burst into laughter.

"
part5371.0
Did you see his face, the great lump?"

part5372.0

The other Slytherins joined in.

"Shut
part5373.0
 up, Malfoy," snapped Parvati Patil.

"
part5374.0
Ooh, sticking up for Longbottom?" said 
part5375.0
Pansy Parkinson, a hard-faced
Slytherin
part5376.0
 girl. "Never thought you'd like fat li
part5377.0
ttle crybabies,
Parvati."

"Look!" said
part5378.0
 Malfoy, darting forward and snatching 
part5379.0
something out of the
grass. "It's that 
part5380.0
stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him
part5381.0
."

The Remembrall glittered in the sun
part5382.0
 as he held it up.

"Give that here, Ma
part5383.0
lfoy," said Harry quietly. Everyone sto
part5384.0
pped talking
to watch.

Malfoy smiled n
part5385.0
astily.

"I think I'll leave it somewhe
part5386.0
re for Longbottom to find -- how about 
part5387.0
--
up a tree?"

"Give it here!" Harry y
part5388.0
elled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his br
part5389.0
oomstick
and taken off. He hadn't been 
part5390.0
lying, he could fly well. Hovering leve
part5391.0
l
with the topmost branches of an oak h
part5392.0
e called, "Come and get it,
Potter!"

H
part5393.0
arry grabbed his broom.

"No!" shouted 
part5394.0
Hermione Granger. "Madam Hooch told us 
part5395.0
not to move --
you'll get us all into t
part5396.0
rouble."

Harry ignored her. Blood was 
part5397.0
pounding in his ears. He mounted the br
part5398.0
oom
and kicked hard against the ground 
part5399.0
and up, up he soared; air rushed
throug
part5400.0
h his hair, and his robes whipped out b
part5401.0
ehind him -and in a rush of
fierce joy 
part5402.0
he realized he'd found something he cou
part5403.0
ld do without being
taught -- this was 
part5404.0
easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his
part5405.0
 broomstick up
a little to take it even
part5406.0
 higher, and heard screams and gasps of
part5407.0
 girls
back on the ground and an admiri
part5408.0
ng whoop from Ron.

He turned his broom
part5409.0
stick sharply to face Malfoy in midair.
part5410.0
 Malfoy looked
stunned.

"Give it here,
part5411.0
" Harry called, "or I'll knock you off 
part5412.0
that broom!" "Oh,
yeah?" said Malfoy, t
part5413.0
rying to sneer, but looking worried.

H
part5414.0
arry knew, somehow, what to do. He lean
part5415.0
ed forward and grasped the broom
tightl
part5416.0
y in both hands, and it shot toward Mal
part5417.0
fay like a javelin. Malfoy
only just go
part5418.0
t out of the way in time; Harry made a 
part5419.0
sharp about-face and
held the broom ste
part5420.0
ady. A few people below were clapping.

part5421.0

"No Crabbe and Goyle up here to save y
part5422.0
our neck, Malfoy," Harry called.

The s
part5423.0
ame thought seemed to have struck Malfo
part5424.0
y.

"Catch it if you can, then!" he sho
part5425.0
uted, and he threw the glass ball
high 
part5426.0
into the air and streaked back toward t
part5427.0
he ground.

Harry saw, as though in slo
part5428.0
w motion, the ball rise up in the air a
part5429.0
nd
then start to fall. He leaned forwar
part5430.0
d and pointed his broom handle down
-- 
part5431.0
next second he was gathering speed in a
part5432.0
 steep dive, racing the ball
-- wind wh
part5433.0
istled in his ears, mingled with the sc
part5434.0
reams of people
watching -- he stretche
part5435.0
d out his hand -- a foot from the groun
part5436.0
d he
caught it, just in time to pull hi
part5437.0
s broom straight, and he toppled
gently
part5438.0
 onto the grass with the Remembrall clu
part5439.0
tched safely in his fist.

"HARRY POTTE
part5440.0
R!"

His heart sank faster than he'd ju
part5441.0
st dived. Professor McGonagall was
runn
part5442.0
ing toward them. He got to his feet, tr
part5443.0
embling.

"Never -- in all my time at H
part5444.0
ogwarts --"

Professor McGonagall was a
part5445.0
lmost speechless with shock, and her gl
part5446.0
asses
flashed furiously, "-- how dare y
part5447.0
ou -- might have broken your neck --"


part5448.0
"It wasn't his fault, Professor --"

"B
part5449.0
e quiet, Miss Patil

"But Malfoy --"

"
part5450.0
That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, fol
part5451.0
low me, now."

Harry caught sight of Ma
part5452.0
lfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant fa
part5453.0
ces as he
left, walking numbly in Profe
part5454.0
ssor McGonagall's wake as she strode to
part5455.0
ward
the castle. He was going to be exp
part5456.0
elled, he just knew it. He wanted to
sa
part5457.0
y something to defend himself, but ther
part5458.0
e seemed to be something wrong
with his
part5459.0
 voice. Professor McGonagall was sweepi
part5460.0
ng along without even
looking at him; h
part5461.0
e had to jog to keep up. Now he'd done 
part5462.0
it. He hadn't
even lasted two weeks. He
part5463.0
'd be packing his bags in ten minutes. 
part5464.0
What
would the Dursleys say when he tur
part5465.0
ned up on the doorstep?

Up the front s
part5466.0
teps, up the marble staircase inside, a
part5467.0
nd still Professor
McGonagall didn't sa
part5468.0
y a word to him. She wrenched open door
part5469.0
s and marched
along corridors with Harr
part5470.0
y trotting miserably behind her. Maybe 
part5471.0
she was
taking him to Dumbledore. He th
part5472.0
ought of Hagrid, expelled but allowed t
part5473.0
o
stay on as gamekeeper. Perhaps he cou
part5474.0
ld be Hagrid's assistant. His
stomach t
part5475.0
wisted as he imagined it, watching Ron 
part5476.0
and the others becoming
wizards, while 
part5477.0
he stumped around the grounds carrying 
part5478.0
Hagrid's bag.

Professor McGonagall sto
part5479.0
pped outside a classroom. She opened th
part5480.0
e door
and poked her head inside.

"Exc
part5481.0
use me, Professor Flitwick, could I bor
part5482.0
row Wood for a moment?"

Wood? thought 
part5483.0
Harry, bewildered; was Wood a cane she 
part5484.0
was going to use on
him?

But Wood turn
part5485.0
ed out to be a person, a burly fifth-ye
part5486.0
ar boy who came out
of Flitwicles class
part5487.0
 looking confused.

"Follow me, you two
part5488.0
," said Professor McGonagall, and they 
part5489.0
marched on up
the corridor, Wood lookin
part5490.0
g curiously at Harry.

"In here."

Prof
part5491.0
essor McGonagall pointed them into a cl
part5492.0
assroom that was empty except
for Peeve
part5493.0
s, who was busy writing rude words on t
part5494.0
he blackboard.

"Out, Peeves!" she bark
part5495.0
ed. Peeves threw the chalk into a bin, 
part5496.0
which
clanged loudly, and he swooped ou
part5497.0
t cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed
part5498.0

the door behind him and turned to face
part5499.0
 the two boys.

"Potter, this is Oliver
part5500.0
 Wood. Wood -- I've found you a Seeker.
part5501.0
"

Wood's expression changed from puzzl
part5502.0
ement to delight.

"Are you serious, Pr
part5503.0
ofessor?"

"Absolutely," said Professor
part5504.0
 McGonagall crisply. "The boy's a natur
part5505.0
al.
I've never seen anything like it. W
part5506.0
as that your first time on a
broomstick
part5507.0
, Potter?"

Harry nodded silently. He d
part5508.0
idn't have a clue what was going on, bu
part5509.0
t he
didn't seem to be being expelled, 
part5510.0
and some of the feeling started coming

part5511.0
back to his legs.

"He caught that thin
part5512.0
g in his hand after a fifty-foot dive,"
part5513.0
 Professor
McGonagall told Wood. "Didn'
part5514.0
t even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley
part5515.0

couldn't have done it."

Wood was now 
part5516.0
looking as though all his dreams had co
part5517.0
me true at once.

"Ever seen a game of 
part5518.0
Quidditch, Potter?" he asked excitedly.
part5519.0


"Wood's captain of the Gryffindor tea
part5520.0
m," Professor McGonagall explained.

"H
part5521.0
e's just the build for a Seeker, too," 
part5522.0
said Wood, now walking around
Harry and
part5523.0
 staring at him. "Light -- speedy -- we
part5524.0
'll have to get him a
decent broom, Pro
part5525.0
fessor -- a Nimbus Two Thousand or a Cl
part5526.0
eansweep Seven,
I'd say."

I shall spea
part5527.0
k to Professor Dumbledore and see if we
part5528.0
 can't bend the
first-year rule. Heaven
part5529.0
 knows, we need a better team than last
part5530.0
 year.
Flattened in that last match by 
part5531.0
Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snap
part5532.0
e
in the face for weeks...."

Professor
part5533.0
 McGonagall peered sternly over her gla
part5534.0
sses at Harry.

"I want to hear you're 
part5535.0
training hard, Potter, or I may change 
part5536.0
my mind
about punishing you."

Then she
part5537.0
 suddenly smiled.

"Your father would h
part5538.0
ave been proud," she said. "He was an e
part5539.0
xcellent
Quidditch player himself."

"Y
part5540.0
ou're joking."

It was dinnertime. Harr
part5541.0
y had just finished telling Ron what ha
part5542.0
d happened
when he'd left the grounds w
part5543.0
ith Professor McGonagall. Ron had a pie
part5544.0
ce of
steak and kidney pie halfway to h
part5545.0
is mouth, but he'd forgotten all about

part5546.0
it.

"Seeker?" he said. "But first year
part5547.0
s never -- you must be the youngest
hou
part5548.0
se player in about a century, said Harr
part5549.0
y, shoveling pie into his
mouth. He fel
part5550.0
t particularly hungry after the excitem
part5551.0
ent of the
afternoon. "Wood told me."


part5552.0
Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he jus
part5553.0
t sat and gaped at Harry.

"I start tra
part5554.0
ining next week," said Harry. "Only don
part5555.0
't tell anyone, Wood
wants to keep it a
part5556.0
 secret."

Fred and George Weasley now 
part5557.0
came into the hall, spotted Harry, and

part5558.0
hurried over.

"Well done," said George
part5559.0
 in a low voice. "Wood told us. We're o
part5560.0
n the
team too -- Beaters."

"I tell yo
part5561.0
u, we're going to win that Quidditch cu
part5562.0
p for sure this year,"
said Fred. "We h
part5563.0
aven't won since Charlie left, but this
part5564.0
 year's team is
going to be brilliant. 
part5565.0
You must be good, Harry, Wood was almos
part5566.0
t skipping
when he told us."

"Anyway, 
part5567.0
we've got to go, Lee Jordan reckons he'
part5568.0
s found a new secret
passageway out of 
part5569.0
the school."

"Bet it's that one behind
part5570.0
 the statue of Gregory the Smarmy that 
part5571.0
we found
in our first week. See you."


part5572.0
Fred and George had hardly disappeared 
part5573.0
when someone far less welcome
turned up
part5574.0
: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.

part5575.0

"Having a last meal, Potter? When are 
part5576.0
you getting the train back to the
Muggl
part5577.0
es?"

"You're a lot braver now that you
part5578.0
're back on the ground and you've got
y
part5579.0
our little friends with you," said Harr
part5580.0
y coolly. There was of course
nothing a
part5581.0
t all little about Crabbe and Goyle, bu
part5582.0
t as the High Table was
full of teacher
part5583.0
s, neither of them could do more than c
part5584.0
rack their
knuckles and scowl.

"I'd ta
part5585.0
ke you on anytime on my own," said Malf
part5586.0
oy. "Tonight, if you want.
Wizard's due
part5587.0
l. Wands only -- no contact. What's the
part5588.0
 matter? Never heard
of a wizard's duel
part5589.0
 before, I suppose?"

"Of course he has
part5590.0
," said Ron, wheeling around. "I'm his 
part5591.0
second, who's
yours?"

Malfoy looked at
part5592.0
 Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.

"Cr
part5593.0
abbe," he said. "Midnight all right? We
part5594.0
'll meet you in the trophy
room; that's
part5595.0
 always unlocked."

When Malfoy had gon
part5596.0
e, Ron and Harry looked at each other. 
part5597.0
"What is a
wizard's duel?" said Harry. 
part5598.0
"And what do you mean, you're my second
part5599.0
?"

"Well, a second's there to take ove
part5600.0
r if you die," said Ron casually,
getti
part5601.0
ng started at last on his cold pie. Cat
part5602.0
ching the look on Harry's
face, he adde
part5603.0
d quickly, "But people only die in prop
part5604.0
er duels, you know,
with real wizards. 
part5605.0
The most you and Malfoy'll be able to d
part5606.0
o is send
sparks at each other. Neither
part5607.0
 of you knows enough magic to do any re
part5608.0
al
damage. I bet he expected you to ref
part5609.0
use, anyway."

"And what if I wave my w
part5610.0
and and nothing happens?"

"Throw it aw
part5611.0
ay and punch him on the nose," Ron sugg
part5612.0
ested. "Excuse me."

They both looked u
part5613.0
p. It was Hermione Granger.

"Can't a p
part5614.0
erson eat in peace in this place?" said
part5615.0
 Ron.

Hermione ignored him and spoke t
part5616.0
o Harry.

"I couldn't help overhearing 
part5617.0
what you and Malfoy were saying --"

"B
part5618.0
et you could," Ron muttered.

"--and yo
part5619.0
u mustn't go wandering around the schoo
part5620.0
l at night, think of the
points you'll 
part5621.0
lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and y
part5622.0
ou're bound to be.
It's really very sel
part5623.0
fish of you."

"And it's really none of
part5624.0
 your business," said Harry.

"Good-bye
part5625.0
," said Ron.

All the same, it wasn't w
part5626.0
hat you'd call the perfect end to the d
part5627.0
ay,
Harry thought, as he lay awake much
part5628.0
 later listening to Dean and Seamus
fal
part5629.0
ling asleep (Neville wasn't back from t
part5630.0
he hospital wing). Ron had
spent all ev
part5631.0
ening giving him advice such as "If he 
part5632.0
tries to curse you,
you'd better dodge 
part5633.0
it, because I can't remember how to blo
part5634.0
ck them."
There was a very good chance 
part5635.0
they were going to get caught by Filch 
part5636.0
or
Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was p
part5637.0
ushing his luck, breaking another
schoo
part5638.0
l rule today. On the other hand, Malfoy
part5639.0
s sneering face kept looming
up out of 
part5640.0
the darkness - this was his big chance 
part5641.0
to beat Malfoy
face-to-face. He couldn'
part5642.0
t miss it.

"Half-past eleven," Ron mut
part5643.0
tered at last, "we'd better go."

They 
part5644.0
pulled on their bathrobes, picked up th
part5645.0
eir wands, and crept across
the tower r
part5646.0
oom, down the spiral staircase, and int
part5647.0
o the Gryffindor
common room. A few emb
part5648.0
ers were still glowing in the fireplace
part5649.0
, turning
all the armchairs into hunche
part5650.0
d black shadows. They had almost reache
part5651.0
d
the portrait hole when a voice spoke 
part5652.0
from the chair nearest them, "I
can't b
part5653.0
elieve you're going to do this, Harry."
part5654.0


A lamp flickered on. It was Hermione 
part5655.0
Granger, wearing a pink bathrobe
and a 
part5656.0
frown.

"You!" said Ron furiously. "Go 
part5657.0
back to bed!"

"I almost told your brot
part5658.0
her," Hermione snapped, "Percy -- he's 
part5659.0
a
prefect, he'd put a stop to this."

H
part5660.0
arry couldn't believe anyone could be s
part5661.0
o interfering.

"Come on," he said to R
part5662.0
on. He pushed open the portrait of the 
part5663.0
Fat Lady
and climbed through the hole.

part5664.0

Hermione wasn't going to give up that 
part5665.0
easily. She followed Ron through
the po
part5666.0
rtrait hole, hissing at them like an an
part5667.0
gry goose.

"Don't you care about Gryff
part5668.0
indor, do you only care about yourselve
part5669.0
s, I
don't want Slytherin to win the ho
part5670.0
use cup, and you'll lose all the
points
part5671.0
 I got from Professor McGonagall for kn
part5672.0
owing about Switching
Spells."

"Go awa
part5673.0
y." "All right, but I warned you, you j
part5674.0
ust remember what I said
when you're on
part5675.0
 the train home tomorrow, you're so --"
part5676.0


But what they were, they didn't find 
part5677.0
out. Hermione had turned to the
portrai
part5678.0
t of the Fat Lady to get back inside an
part5679.0
d found herself facing an
empty paintin
part5680.0
g. The Fat Lady had gone on a nighttime
part5681.0
 visit and Hermione
was locked out of G
part5682.0
ryffindor tower.

"Now what am I going 
part5683.0
to do?" she asked shrilly.

"That's you
part5684.0
r problem," said Ron. "We've got to go,
part5685.0
 we 3 re going to be
late."

They hadn'
part5686.0
t even reached the end of the corridor 
part5687.0
when Hermione caught up
with them.

"I'
part5688.0
m coming with you," she said.

"You are
part5689.0
 not."

"D'you think I'm going to stand
part5690.0
 out here and wait for Filch to catch m
part5691.0
e?
If he finds all three of us I'll tel
part5692.0
l him the truth, that I was trying
to s
part5693.0
top you, and you can back me up."

"You
part5694.0
've got some nerve --" said Ron loudly.
part5695.0


"Shut up, both of you!" said Harry sh
part5696.0
arply. I heard something."

It was a so
part5697.0
rt of snuffling.

"Mrs. Norris?" breath
part5698.0
ed Ron, squinting through the dark.

It
part5699.0
 wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He
part5700.0
 was curled up on the floor,
fast aslee
part5701.0
p, but jerked suddenly awake as they cr
part5702.0
ept nearer.

"Thank goodness you found 
part5703.0
me! I've been out here for hours, I cou
part5704.0
ldn't
remember the new password to get 
part5705.0
in to bed."

"Keep your voice down, Nev
part5706.0
ille. The password's 'Pig snout' but it
part5707.0
 won't
help you now, the Fat Lady's gon
part5708.0
e off somewhere."

"How's your arm?" sa
part5709.0
id Harry.

"Fine," said Neville, showin
part5710.0
g them. "Madam Pomfrey mended it in abo
part5711.0
ut a
minute."

"Good - well, look, Nevi
part5712.0
lle, we've got to be somewhere, we'll s
part5713.0
ee you
later --"

"Don't leave me!" sai
part5714.0
d Neville, scrambling to his feet, "I d
part5715.0
on't want to
stay here alone, the Blood
part5716.0
y Baron's been past twice already."

Ro
part5717.0
n looked at his watch and then glared f
part5718.0
uriously at Hermione and
Neville.

"If 
part5719.0
either of you get us caught, I'll never
part5720.0
 rest until I've learned that
Curse of 
part5721.0
the Bogies Quirrell told us about, and 
part5722.0
used it on you.

Hermione opened her mo
part5723.0
uth, perhaps to tell Ron exactly how to
part5724.0
 use the
Curse of the Bogies, but Harry
part5725.0
 hissed at her to be quiet and beckoned
part5726.0

them all forward.

They flitted along 
part5727.0
corridors striped with bars of moonligh
part5728.0
t from the
high windows. At every turn 
part5729.0
Harry expected to run into Filch or Mrs
part5730.0
.
Norris, but they were lucky. They spe
part5731.0
d up a staircase to the third floor
and
part5732.0
 tiptoed toward the trophy room.

Malfo
part5733.0
y and Crabbe weren't there yet. The cry
part5734.0
stal trophy cases glimmered
where the m
part5735.0
oonlight caught them. Cups, shields, pl
part5736.0
ates, and statues
winked silver and gol
part5737.0
d in the darkness. They edged along the
part5738.0
 walls,
keeping their eyes on the doors
part5739.0
 at either end of the room. Harry took

part5740.0
out his wand in case Malfoy leapt in an
part5741.0
d started at once. The minutes
crept by
part5742.0
.

"He's late, maybe he's chickened out
part5743.0
," Ron whispered.

Then a noise in the 
part5744.0
next room made them jump. Harry had onl
part5745.0
y just raised
his wand when they heard 
part5746.0
someone speak -and it wasn't Malfoy.

"
part5747.0
Sniff around, my sweet, they might be l
part5748.0
urking in a corner."

It was Filch spea
part5749.0
king to Mrs. Norris. Horror-struck, Har
part5750.0
ry waved madly
at the other three to fo
part5751.0
llow him as quickly as possible; they s
part5752.0
curried
silently toward the door, away 
part5753.0
from Filch's voice. Neville's robes had
part5754.0

barely whipped round the corner when t
part5755.0
hey heard Filch enter the trophy
room.

part5756.0

"They're in here somewhere," they hear
part5757.0
d him mutter, "probably hiding."

"This
part5758.0
 way!" Harry mouthed to the others and,
part5759.0
 petrified, they began to
creep down a 
part5760.0
long gallery full of suits of armor. Th
part5761.0
ey could hear Filch
getting nearer. Nev
part5762.0
ille suddenly let out a frightened sque
part5763.0
ak and broke
into a run -he tripped, gr
part5764.0
abbed Ron around the waist, and the pai
part5765.0
r of
them toppled right into a suit of 
part5766.0
armor.

The clanging and crashing were 
part5767.0
enough to wake the whole castle.

"RUN!
part5768.0
" Harry yelled, and the four of them sp
part5769.0
rinted down the gallery, not
looking ba
part5770.0
ck to see whether Filch was following -
part5771.0
- they swung around the
doorpost and ga
part5772.0
lloped down one corridor then another, 
part5773.0
Harry in the lead,
without any idea whe
part5774.0
re they were or where they were going -
part5775.0
- they ripped
through a tapestry and fo
part5776.0
und themselves in a hidden passageway, 
part5777.0
hurtled
along it and came out near thei
part5778.0
r Charms classroom, which they knew was
part5779.0

miles from the trophy room.

"I think 
part5780.0
we've lost him," Harry panted, leaning 
part5781.0
against the cold wall
and wiping his fo
part5782.0
rehead. Neville was bent double, wheezi
part5783.0
ng and
spluttering.

I -- told -you," H
part5784.0
ermione gasped, clutching at the stitch
part5785.0
 in her chest,
"I -- told -- you."

"We
part5786.0
've got to get back to Gryffindor tower
part5787.0
," said Ron, "quickly as
possible."

"M
part5788.0
alfoy tricked you," Hermione said to Ha
part5789.0
rry. "You realize that, don't
you? He w
part5790.0
as never going to meet you -- Filch kne
part5791.0
w someone was going to
be in the trophy
part5792.0
 room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.
part5793.0
"

Harry thought she was probably right
part5794.0
, but he wasn't going to tell her
that.
part5795.0


"Let's go."

It wasn't going to be th
part5796.0
at simple. They hadn't gone more than a
part5797.0
 dozen
paces when a doorknob rattled an
part5798.0
d something came shooting out of a
clas
part5799.0
sroom in front of them.

It was Peeves.
part5800.0
 He caught sight of them and gave a squ
part5801.0
eal of delight.

"Shut up, Peeves -- pl
part5802.0
ease -- you'll get us thrown out."

Pee
part5803.0
ves cackled.

"Wandering around at midn
part5804.0
ight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Na
part5805.0
ughty,
naughty, you'll get caughty."

"
part5806.0
Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, 
part5807.0
please."

"Should tell Filch, I should,
part5808.0
" said Peeves in a saintly voice, but h
part5809.0
is
eyes glittered wickedly. "It's for y
part5810.0
our own good, you know."

"Get out of t
part5811.0
he way," snapped Ron, taking a swipe at
part5812.0
 Peeves this was a
big mistake.

"STUDE
part5813.0
NTS OUT OF BED!" Peeves bellowed, "STUD
part5814.0
ENTS OUT OF BED DOWN THE
CHARMS CORRIDO
part5815.0
R"

Ducking under Peeves, they ran for 
part5816.0
their lives, right to the end of the
co
part5817.0
rridor where they slammed into a door -
part5818.0
- and it was locked.

"This is it!" Ron
part5819.0
 moaned, as they pushed helplessly at t
part5820.0
he door, "We're
done for! This is the e
part5821.0
nd!" They could hear footsteps, Filch r
part5822.0
unning as
fast as he could toward Peeve
part5823.0
s's shouts.

"Oh, move over," Hermione 
part5824.0
snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapp
part5825.0
ed the
lock, and whispered, 'Alohomora!
part5826.0
"

The lock clicked and the door swung 
part5827.0
open -- they piled through it, shut
it 
part5828.0
quickly, and pressed their ears against
part5829.0
 it, listening.

"Which way did they go
part5830.0
, Peeves?" Filch was saying. "Quick, te
part5831.0
ll me."

"Say 'please."'

"Don't mess w
part5832.0
ith me, Peeves, now where did they go?"
part5833.0


"Shan't say nothing if you don't say 
part5834.0
please," said Peeves in his
annoying si
part5835.0
ngsong voice.

"All right -please."

"N
part5836.0
OTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't sa
part5837.0
y nothing if you didn't say
please! Ha 
part5838.0
ha! Haaaaaa!" And they heard the sound 
part5839.0
of Peeves whooshing
away and Filch curs
part5840.0
ing in rage.

"He thinks this door is l
part5841.0
ocked," Harry whispered. "I think we'll
part5842.0
 be okay
-- get off, Neville!" For Nevi
part5843.0
lle had been tugging on the sleeve of
H
part5844.0
arry's bathrobe for the last minute. "W
part5845.0
hat?"

Harry turned around -- and saw, 
part5846.0
quite clearly, what. For a moment, he
w
part5847.0
as sure he'd walked into a nightmare --
part5848.0
 this was too much, on top of
everythin
part5849.0
g that had happened so far.

They weren
part5850.0
't in a room, as he had supposed. They 
part5851.0
were in a corridor. The
forbidden corri
part5852.0
dor on the third floor. And now they kn
part5853.0
ew why it was
forbidden.

They were loo
part5854.0
king straight into the eyes of a monstr
part5855.0
ous dog, a dog that
filled the whole sp
part5856.0
ace between ceiling and floor. It had t
part5857.0
hree heads.
Three pairs of rolling, mad
part5858.0
 eyes; three noses, twitching

and quiv
part5859.0
ering in their direction; three droolin
part5860.0
g mouths, saliva hanging
in slippery ro
part5861.0
pes from yellowish fangs.

It was stand
part5862.0
ing quite still, all six eyes staring a
part5863.0
t them, and Harry
knew that the only re
part5864.0
ason they weren't already dead was that
part5865.0
 their
sudden appearance had taken it b
part5866.0
y surprise, but it was quickly getting

part5867.0
over that, there was no mistaking what 
part5868.0
those thunderous growls meant.

Harry g
part5869.0
roped for the doorknob -- between Filch
part5870.0
 and death, he'd take
Filch.

They fell
part5871.0
 backward -- Harry slammed the door shu
part5872.0
t, and they ran, they
almost flew, back
part5873.0
 down the corridor. Filch must have hur
part5874.0
ried off to look
for them somewhere els
part5875.0
e, because they didn't see him anywhere
part5876.0
, but they
hardly cared -- all they wan
part5877.0
ted to do was put as much space as poss
part5878.0
ible
between them and that monster. The
part5879.0
y didn't stop running until they
reache
part5880.0
d the portrait of the Fat Lady on the s
part5881.0
eventh floor.

"Where on earth have you
part5882.0
 all been?" she asked, looking at their
part5883.0

bathrobes hanging off their shoulders 
part5884.0
and their flushed, sweaty faces.

"Neve
part5885.0
r mind that -- pig snout, pig snout," p
part5886.0
anted Harry, and the
portrait swung for
part5887.0
ward. They scrambled into the common ro
part5888.0
om and
collapsed, trembling, into armch
part5889.0
airs.

It was a while before any of the
part5890.0
m said anything. Neville, indeed, looke
part5891.0
d
as if he'd never speak again.

"What 
part5892.0
do they think they're doing, keeping a 
part5893.0
thing like that locked up
in a school?"
part5894.0
 said Ron finally. "If any dog needs ex
part5895.0
ercise, that one
does."

Hermione had g
part5896.0
ot both her breath and her bad temper b
part5897.0
ack again. "You
don't use your eyes, an
part5898.0
y of you, do you?" she snapped. "Didn't
part5899.0
 you see
what it was standing on.

"The
part5900.0
 floor?" Harry suggested. "I wasn't loo
part5901.0
king at its feet, I was too
busy with i
part5902.0
ts heads."

"No, not the floor. It was 
part5903.0
standing on a trapdoor. It's obviously

part5904.0
guarding something."

She stood up, gla
part5905.0
ring at them.

I hope you're pleased wi
part5906.0
th yourselves. We could all have been k
part5907.0
illed --
or worse, expelled. Now, if yo
part5908.0
u don't mind, I'm going to bed."

Ron s
part5909.0
tared after her, his mouth open.

"No, 
part5910.0
we don't mind," he said. "You'd think w
part5911.0
e dragged her along,
wouldn't you.

But
part5912.0
 Hermione had given Harry something els
part5913.0
e to think about as he climbed
back int
part5914.0
o bed. The dog was guarding something..
part5915.0
.. What had Hagrid said?
Gringotts was 
part5916.0
the safest place in the world for somet
part5917.0
hing you wanted to
hide -- except perha
part5918.0
ps Hogwarts.

It looked as though Harry
part5919.0
 had found out where the grubby littie 
part5920.0
package
from vault seven hundred and th
part5921.0
irteen was.


CHAPTER TEN

HALLOWEEN

M
part5922.0
alfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he
part5923.0
 saw that Harry and Ron were
still at H
part5924.0
ogwarts the next day, looking tired but
part5925.0
 perfectly cheerful.
Indeed, by the nex
part5926.0
t morning Harry and Ron thought that me
part5927.0
eting the
three-headed dog had been an 
part5928.0
excellent adventure, and they were quit
part5929.0
e
keen to have another one. In the mean
part5930.0
time, Harry filled Ron in about the
pac
part5931.0
kage that seemed to have been moved fro
part5932.0
m Gringotts to Hogwarts, and
they spent
part5933.0
 a lot of time wondering what could pos
part5934.0
sibly need such heavy
protection. "It's
part5935.0
 either really valuable or really dange
part5936.0
rous," said Ron.
"Or both," said Harry.
part5937.0



But as all they knew for sure about 
part5938.0
the mysterious object was that it
was a
part5939.0
bout two inches long, they didn't have 
part5940.0
much chance of guessing what
it was wit
part5941.0
hout further clues.

Neither Neville no
part5942.0
r Hermione showed the slightest interes
part5943.0
t in what lay
underneath the dog and th
part5944.0
e trapdoor. All Neville cared about was
part5945.0
 never
going near the dog again.

Hermi
part5946.0
one was now refusing to speak to Harry 
part5947.0
and Ron, but she was such a
bossy know-
part5948.0
it-all that they saw this as an added b
part5949.0
onus. All they really
wanted now was a 
part5950.0
way of getting back at Malfoy, and to t
part5951.0
heir great
delight, just such a thing a
part5952.0
rrived in the mail about a week later.

part5953.0

As the owls flooded into the Great Hal
part5954.0
l as usual, everyone's attention
was ca
part5955.0
ught at once by a long, thin package ca
part5956.0
rried by six large screech
owls. Harry 
part5957.0
was just as interested as everyone else
part5958.0
 to see what was in
this large parcel, 
part5959.0
and was amazed when the owls soared dow
part5960.0
n and dropped
it right in front of him,
part5961.0
 knocking his bacon to the floor. They 
part5962.0
had
hardly fluttered out of the way whe
part5963.0
n another owl dropped a letter on top
o
part5964.0
f the parcel.

Harry ripped open the le
part5965.0
tter first, which was lucky, because it
part5966.0
 said:


DO NOT OPEN THE PARCEL AT THE 
part5967.0
TABLE.

It contains your new Nimbus Two
part5968.0
 Thousand, but I don't want everybody
k
part5969.0
nowing you've got a broomstick or they'
part5970.0
ll all want one. Oliver Wood
will meet 
part5971.0
you tonight on the Quidditch field at s
part5972.0
even o'clock for your
first training se
part5973.0
ssion.

Professor McGonagall

Harry had
part5974.0
 difficulty hiding his glee as he hande
part5975.0
d the note to Ron to
read.

"A Nimbus T
part5976.0
wo Thousand!" Ron moaned enviously. "I'
part5977.0
ve never even touched
one."

They left 
part5978.0
the hall quickly, wanting to unwrap the
part5979.0
 broomstick in private
before their fir
part5980.0
st class, but halfway across the entran
part5981.0
ce hall they
found the way upstairs bar
part5982.0
red by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized 
part5983.0
the
package from Harry and felt it.

"T
part5984.0
hat's a broomstick," he said, throwing 
part5985.0
it back to Harry with a mixture
of jeal
part5986.0
ousy and spite on his face. "You'll be 
part5987.0
in for it this time,
Potter, first year
part5988.0
s aren't allowed them."

Ron couldn't r
part5989.0
esist it.

"It's not any old broomstick
part5990.0
," he said, "it's a Nimbus Two Thousand
part5991.0
.
What did you say you've got at home, 
part5992.0
Malfoy, a Comet Two Sixty?" Ron
grinned
part5993.0
 at Harry. "Comets look flashy, but the
part5994.0
y're not in the same
league as the Nimb
part5995.0
us."

"What would you know about it, We
part5996.0
asley, you couldn't afford half the
han
part5997.0
dle," Malfoy snapped back. "I suppose y
part5998.0
ou and your brothers have to
save up tw
part5999.0
ig by twig."

Before Ron could answer, 
part6000.0
Professor Flitwick appeared at Malfoy's
part6001.0
 elbow.

"Not arguing, I hope, boys?" h
part6002.0
e squeaked.

"Potter's been sent a broo
part6003.0
mstick, Professor," said Malfoy quickly
part6004.0
.

"Yes, yes, that's right," said Profe
part6005.0
ssor Flitwick, beaming at Harry.
"Profe
part6006.0
ssor McGonagall told me all about the s
part6007.0
pecial circumstances,
Potter. And what 
part6008.0
model is it?"

"A Nimbus Two Thousand, 
part6009.0
sit," said Harry, fighting not to laugh
part6010.0
 at the
look of horror on Malfoy's face
part6011.0
. "And it's really thanks to Malfoy her
part6012.0
e
that I've got it," he added.

Harry a
part6013.0
nd Ron headed upstairs, smothering thei
part6014.0
r laughter at Malfoy's
obvious rage and
part6015.0
 confusion. "Well, it's true," Harry ch
part6016.0
ortled as they
reached the top of the m
part6017.0
arble staircase, "If he hadn't stolen N
part6018.0
eville's
Remembrall I wouln't be on the
part6019.0
 team...."

"So I suppose you think tha
part6020.0
t's a reward for breaking rules?" came 
part6021.0
an
angry voice from just behind them. H
part6022.0
ermione was stomping up the stairs,
loo
part6023.0
king disapprovingly at the package in H
part6024.0
arry's hand.

"I thought you weren't sp
part6025.0
eaking to us?" said Harry.

"Yes, don't
part6026.0
 stop now," said Ron, "it's doing us so
part6027.0
 much good."

Hermione marched away wit
part6028.0
h her nose in the air.

Harry had a lot
part6029.0
 of trouble keeping his mind on his les
part6030.0
sons that day. It
kept wandering up to 
part6031.0
the dormitory where his new broomstick 
part6032.0
was lying
under his bed, or straying of
part6033.0
f to the Quidditch field where he'd be

part6034.0
learning to play that night. He bolted 
part6035.0
his dinner that evening without
noticin
part6036.0
g what he was eating, and then rushed u
part6037.0
pstairs with Ron to unwrap
the Nimbus T
part6038.0
wo Thousand at last.

"Wow," Ron sighed
part6039.0
, as the broomstick rolled onto Harry's
part6040.0
 bedspread.

Even Harry, who knew nothi
part6041.0
ng about the different brooms, thought 
part6042.0
it
looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, w
part6043.0
ith a mahogany handle, it had a long
ta
part6044.0
il of neat, straight twigs and Nimbus T
part6045.0
wo Thousand written in gold
near the to
part6046.0
p.

As seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry
part6047.0
 left the castle and set off in the
dus
part6048.0
k toward the Quidditch field. Held neve
part6049.0
r been inside the stadium
before. Hundr
part6050.0
eds of seats were raised in stands arou
part6051.0
nd the field so that
the spectators wer
part6052.0
e high enough to see what was going on.
part6053.0
 At either end
of the field were three 
part6054.0
golden poles with hoops on the end. The
part6055.0
y
reminded Harry of the little plastic 
part6056.0
sticks Muggle

children blew bubbles th
part6057.0
rough, except that they were fifty feet
part6058.0
 high.

Too eager to fly again to wait 
part6059.0
for Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick

part6060.0
and kicked off from the ground. What a 
part6061.0
feeling -- he swooped in and out
of the
part6062.0
 goal posts and then sped up and down t
part6063.0
he field. The Nimbus Two
Thousand turne
part6064.0
d wherever he wanted at his lightest to
part6065.0
uch.

"Hey, Potter, come down!'

Oliver
part6066.0
 Wood had arrived. fie was carrying a l
part6067.0
arge wooden crate under his
arm. Harry 
part6068.0
landed next to him.

"Very nice," said 
part6069.0
Wood, his eyes glinting. "I see what Mc
part6070.0
Gonagall
meant... you really are a natu
part6071.0
ral. I'm just going to teach you the ru
part6072.0
les
this evening, then you'll be joinin
part6073.0
g team practice three times a week."

H
part6074.0
e opened the crate. Inside were four di
part6075.0
fferent-sized balls.

"Right," said Woo
part6076.0
d. "Now, Quidditch is easy enough to un
part6077.0
derstand, even
if it's not too easy to 
part6078.0
play. There are seven players on each s
part6079.0
ide.
Three of them are called Chasers."
part6080.0


"Three Chasers," Harry repeated, as W
part6081.0
ood took out a bright red ball
about th
part6082.0
e size of a soccer ball.

"This ball's 
part6083.0
called the Quaffle," said Wood. "The Ch
part6084.0
asers throw the
Quaffle to each other a
part6085.0
nd try and get it through one of the ho
part6086.0
ops to
score a goal. Ten points every t
part6087.0
ime the Quaffle goes through one of the
part6088.0

hoops. Follow me?"

"The Chasers throw
part6089.0
 the Quaffle and put it through the hoo
part6090.0
ps to score,"
Harry recited. "So -- tha
part6091.0
t's sort of like basketball on broomsti
part6092.0
cks with
six hoops, isn't it?"

"What's
part6093.0
 basketball?" said Wood curiously. "Nev
part6094.0
er mind," said Harry
quickly.

"Now, th
part6095.0
ere's another player on each side who's
part6096.0
 called the Keeper -I'm
Keeper for Gryf
part6097.0
findor. I have to fly around our hoops 
part6098.0
and stop the other
team from scoring."

part6099.0

"Three Chasers, one Keeper," said Harr
part6100.0
y, who was determined to remember
it al
part6101.0
l. "And they play with the Quaffle. Oka
part6102.0
y, got that. So what are
they for?" He 
part6103.0
pointed at the three balls left inside 
part6104.0
the box.

"I'll show you now," said Woo
part6105.0
d. "Take this."

He handed Harry a smal
part6106.0
l club, a bit like a short baseball bat
part6107.0
.

"I'm going to show you what the Blud
part6108.0
gers do," Wood said. "These two are
the
part6109.0
 Bludgers."

He showed Harry two identi
part6110.0
cal balls, jet black and slightly small
part6111.0
er than
the red Quaffle. Harry noticed 
part6112.0
that they seemed to be straining to
esc
part6113.0
ape the straps holding them inside the 
part6114.0
box.

"Stand back," Wood warned Harry. 
part6115.0
He bent down and freed one of the
Bludg
part6116.0
ers.

At once, the black ball rose high
part6117.0
 in the air and then pelted straight at
part6118.0

Harry's face. Harry swung at it with t
part6119.0
he bat to stop it from breaking
his nos
part6120.0
e, and sent it zigzagging away into the
part6121.0
 air -- it zoomed around
their heads an
part6122.0
d then shot at Wood, who dived on top o
part6123.0
f it and managed to
pin it to the groun
part6124.0
d.

"See?" Wood panted, forcing the str
part6125.0
uggling Bludger back into the crate
and
part6126.0
 strapping it down safely. "The Bludger
part6127.0
s rocket around, trying to
knock player
part6128.0
s off their brooms. That's why you have
part6129.0
 two Beaters on each
team -- the Weasle
part6130.0
y twins are ours -- it's their job to p
part6131.0
rotect their
side from the Bludgers and
part6132.0
 try and knock them toward the other te
part6133.0
am. So
-- think you've got all that?"


part6134.0
"Three Chasers try and score with the Q
part6135.0
uaffle; the Keeper guards the
goal post
part6136.0
s; the Beaters keep the Bludgers away f
part6137.0
rom their team," Harry
reeled off.

"Ve
part6138.0
ry good," said Wood.

"Er -- have the B
part6139.0
ludgers ever killed anyone?" Harry aske
part6140.0
d, hoping he
sounded offhand.

"Never a
part6141.0
t Hogwarts. We've had a couple of broke
part6142.0
n jaws but nothing worse
than that. Now
part6143.0
, the last member of the team is the

S
part6144.0
eeker. That's you. And you don't have t
part6145.0
o worry about the Quaffle or the
Bludge
part6146.0
rs unless they crack my head open."

"D
part6147.0
on't worry, the Weasleys are more than 
part6148.0
a match for the Bludgers -- I
mean, the
part6149.0
y're like a pair of human Bludgers them
part6150.0
selves."

Wood reached into the crate a
part6151.0
nd took out the fourth and last ball.
C
part6152.0
ompared with the Quaffle and the Bludge
part6153.0
rs, it was tiny, about the size
of a la
part6154.0
rge walnut. It was bright gold and had 
part6155.0
little fluttering silver
wings.

"This,
part6156.0
" said Wood, "is the Golden Snitch, and
part6157.0
 it's the most important
ball of the lo
part6158.0
t. It's very hard to catch because it's
part6159.0
 so fast and
difficult to see. It's the
part6160.0
 Seeker's job to catch it. You've got t
part6161.0
o weave
in and out of the Chasers, Beat
part6162.0
ers, Bludgers, and Quaffle to get it
be
part6163.0
fore the other team's Seeker, because w
part6164.0
hichever Seeker catches the
Snitch wins
part6165.0
 his team an extra hundred and fifty po
part6166.0
ints, so they

nearly always win. That'
part6167.0
s why Seekers get fouled so much. A gam
part6168.0
e of
Quidditch only ends when the Snitc
part6169.0
h is caught, so it can go on for ages
-
part6170.0
- I think the record is three months, t
part6171.0
hey had to keep bringing on
substitutes
part6172.0
 so the players could get some sleep. "
part6173.0
Well, that's it -- any
questions?"

Har
part6174.0
ry shook his head. He understood what h
part6175.0
e had to do all right, it was
doing it 
part6176.0
that was going to be the problem.

"We 
part6177.0
won't practice with the Snitch yet," sa
part6178.0
id Wood, carefully shutting
it back ins
part6179.0
ide the crate, "it's too dark, we might
part6180.0
 lose it. Let's try
you out with a few 
part6181.0
of these."

He pulled a bag of ordinary
part6182.0
 golf balls out of his pocket and a few
part6183.0

minutes later, he and Harry were up in
part6184.0
 the air, Wood throwing the golf
balls 
part6185.0
as hard as he could in every direction 
part6186.0
for Harry to catch.

Harry didn't miss 
part6187.0
a single one, and Wood was delighted. A
part6188.0
fter half an
hour, night had really fal
part6189.0
len and they couldn't carry on.

"That 
part6190.0
Quidditch cup'll have our name on it th
part6191.0
is year," said Wood happily
as they tru
part6192.0
dged back up to the castle. "I wouldn't
part6193.0
 be surprised if you
turn out better th
part6194.0
an Charlie Weasley, and he could have p
part6195.0
layed for
England if he hadn't gone off
part6196.0
 chasing dragons."

Perhaps it was beca
part6197.0
use he was now so busy, what with Quidd
part6198.0
itch practice
three evenings a week on 
part6199.0
top of all his homework, but Harry coul
part6200.0
d hardly
believe it when he realized th
part6201.0
at he'd already been at Hogwarts two
mo
part6202.0
nths. The castle felt more like home th
part6203.0
an Privet Drive ever had. His
lessons, 
part6204.0
too, were becoming more and more intere
part6205.0
sting now that they had
mastered the ba
part6206.0
sics.

On Halloween morning they woke t
part6207.0
o the delicious smell of baking pumpkin
part6208.0

wafting through the corridors. Even be
part6209.0
tter, Professor Flitwick announced
in C
part6210.0
harms that he thought they were ready t
part6211.0
o start making objects fly,
something t
part6212.0
hey had all been dying to try since the
part6213.0
y'd seen him make
Neville's toad zoom a
part6214.0
round the classroom. Professor Flitwick
part6215.0
 put the
class into pairs to practice. 
part6216.0
Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (wh
part6217.0
ich
was a relief, because Neville had b
part6218.0
een trying to catch his eye). Ron,
howe
part6219.0
ver, was to be working with Hermione Gr
part6220.0
anger. It was hard to tell
whether Ron 
part6221.0
or Hermione was angrier about this. She
part6222.0
 hadn't spoken to
either of them since 
part6223.0
the day Harry's broomstick had arrived.
part6224.0


"Now, don't forget that nice wrist mo
part6225.0
vement we've been practicing!"
squeaked
part6226.0
 Professor Flitwick, perched on top of 
part6227.0
his pile of books as
usual. "Swish and 
part6228.0
flick, remember, swish and flick. And s
part6229.0
aying the magic
words properly is very 
part6230.0
important, too -- never forget Wizard B
part6231.0
aruffio,
who said 's' instead of 'f' an
part6232.0
d found himself on the floor with a
buf
part6233.0
falo on his chest."

It was very diffic
part6234.0
ult. Harry and Seamus swished and flick
part6235.0
ed, but the
feather they were supposed 
part6236.0
to be sending skyward just lay on the
d
part6237.0
esktop. Seamus got so impatient that he
part6238.0
 prodded it with his wand and
set fire 
part6239.0
to it -- Harry had to put it out with h
part6240.0
is hat.

Ron, at the next table, wasn't
part6241.0
 having much more luck.

"Wingardium Le
part6242.0
viosa!" he shouted, waving his long arm
part6243.0
s like a windmill.

"You're saying it w
part6244.0
rong," Harry heard Hermione snap. "It's
part6245.0
 Wing-gar-dium
Levi-o-sa, make the 'gar
part6246.0
' nice and long."


"You do it, then, i
part6247.0
f you're so clever," Ron snarled.

Herm
part6248.0
ione rolled up the sleeves of her gown,
part6249.0
 flicked her wand, and said,
"Wingardiu
part6250.0
m Leviosa!"

Their feather rose off the
part6251.0
 desk and hovered about four feet above
part6252.0
 their
heads.

"Oh, well done!" cried P
part6253.0
rofessor Flitwick, clapping. "Everyone 
part6254.0
see here,
Miss Granger's done it!"

Ron
part6255.0
 was in a very bad mood by the end of t
part6256.0
he class. "It's no wonder no
one can st
part6257.0
and her," he said to Harry as they push
part6258.0
ed their way into the
crowded corridor,
part6259.0
 "she's a nightmare, honestly. "

Someo
part6260.0
ne knocked into Harry as they hurried p
part6261.0
ast him. It was Hermione.
Harry caught 
part6262.0
a glimpse of her face -- and was startl
part6263.0
ed to see that she
was in tears.

"I th
part6264.0
ink she heard you."

"So?" said Ron, bu
part6265.0
t he looked a bit uncomfortable. "She m
part6266.0
ust've noticed
she's got no friends."


part6267.0
Hermione didn't turn up for the next cl
part6268.0
ass and wasn't seen all
afternoon. On t
part6269.0
heir way down to the Great Hall for the
part6270.0
 Halloween feast,
Harry and Ron overhea
part6271.0
rd Parvati Patil telling her friend Lav
part6272.0
ender that
Hermione was crying in the g
part6273.0
irls' bathroom and wanted to be left al
part6274.0
one.
Ron looked still more awkward at t
part6275.0
his, but a moment later they had
entere
part6276.0
d the Great Hall, where the Halloween d
part6277.0
ecorations put Hermione out
of their mi
part6278.0
nds.

A thousand live bats fluttered fr
part6279.0
om the walls and ceiling while a
thousa
part6280.0
nd more swooped over the tables in low 
part6281.0
black clouds, making the
candles in the
part6282.0
 pumpkins stutter. The feast appeared s
part6283.0
uddenly on the
golden plates, as it had
part6284.0
 at the start-of-term banquet.

Harry w
part6285.0
as just helping himself to a baked pota
part6286.0
to when Professor Quirrell
came sprinti
part6287.0
ng into the hall, his turban askew and 
part6288.0
terror on his face.
Everyone stared as 
part6289.0
he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair
part6290.0
, slumped
against the table, and gasped
part6291.0
, "Troll -- in the dungeons -- thought 
part6292.0
you
ought to know."

He then sank to th
part6293.0
e floor in a dead faint.

There was an 
part6294.0
uproar. It took several purple firecrac
part6295.0
kers exploding from
the end of Professo
part6296.0
r Dumbledore's wand to bring silence.


part6297.0
"Prefects," he rumbled, "lead your Hous
part6298.0
es back to the dormitories
immediately!
part6299.0
"

Percy was in his element.

"Follow m
part6300.0
e! Stick together, first years! No need
part6301.0
 to fear the troll if
you follow my ord
part6302.0
ers! Stay close behind me, now. Make wa
part6303.0
y, first years
coming through! Excuse m
part6304.0
e, I'm a prefect!"

"How could a troll 
part6305.0
get in?" Harry asked as they climbed th
part6306.0
e stairs.

"Don't ask me, they're suppo
part6307.0
sed to be really stupid," said Ron. "Ma
part6308.0
ybe
Peeves let it in for a Halloween jo
part6309.0
ke."

They passed different groups of p
part6310.0
eople hurrying in different directions.
part6311.0

As they jostled their way through a cr
part6312.0
owd of confused Hufflepuffs, Harry
sudd
part6313.0
enly grabbed Ron's arm.

"I've just tho
part6314.0
ught -- Hermione."

"What about her?"


part6315.0
"She doesn't know about the troll."

Ro
part6316.0
n bit his lip.

"Oh, all right," he sna
part6317.0
pped. "But Percy'd better not see us."

part6318.0

Ducking down, they joined the Hufflepu
part6319.0
ffs going the other way, slipped
down a
part6320.0
 deserted side corridor, and hurried of
part6321.0
f toward the girls'
bathroom. They had 
part6322.0
just turned the corner when they heard 
part6323.0
quick
footsteps behind them.

"Percy!" 
part6324.0
hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind a larg
part6325.0
e stone griffin.

Peering around it, ho
part6326.0
wever, they saw not Percy but Snape. He
part6327.0
 crossed the
corridor and disappeared f
part6328.0
rom view.

"What's he doing?" Harry whi
part6329.0
spered. "Why isn't he down in the dunge
part6330.0
ons
with the rest of the teachers?"

"S
part6331.0
earch me."

Quietly as possible, they c
part6332.0
rept along the next corridor after Snap
part6333.0
e's
fading footsteps.

"He's heading fo
part6334.0
r the third floor," Harry said, but Ron
part6335.0
 held up his
hand.

"Can you smell some
part6336.0
thing?"

Harry sniffed and a foul stenc
part6337.0
h reached his nostrils, a mixture of ol
part6338.0
d
socks and the kind of public toilet n
part6339.0
o one seems to clean.

And then they he
part6340.0
ard it -- a low grunting, and the shuff
part6341.0
ling footfalls of
gigantic feet. Ron po
part6342.0
inted -- at the end of a passage to the
part6343.0
 left,
something huge was moving toward
part6344.0
 them. They shrank into the shadows and
part6345.0

watched as it emerged into a patch of 
part6346.0
moonlight.

It was a horrible sight. Tw
part6347.0
elve feet tall, its skin was a dull, gr
part6348.0
anite
gray, its great lumpy body like a
part6349.0
 boulder with its small bald head
perch
part6350.0
ed on top like a coconut. It had short 
part6351.0
legs thick as tree trunks
with flat, ho
part6352.0
rny feet. The smell coming from it was 
part6353.0
incredible. It was
holding a huge woode
part6354.0
n club, which dragged along the floor b
part6355.0
ecause its
arms were so long.

The trol
part6356.0
l stopped next to a doorway and peered 
part6357.0
inside. It waggled its
long ears, makin
part6358.0
g up its tiny mind, then slouched slowl
part6359.0
y into the room.

"The keys in the lock
part6360.0
," Harry muttered. "We could lock it in
part6361.0
."

"Good idea," said Ron nervously.

T
part6362.0
hey edged toward the open door, mouths 
part6363.0
dry, praying the troll wasn't
about to 
part6364.0
come out of it. With one great leap, Ha
part6365.0
rry managed to grab the
key, slam the d
part6366.0
oor, and lock it.

'Yes!"

Flushed with
part6367.0
 their victory, they started to run bac
part6368.0
k up the passage, but
as they reached t
part6369.0
he corner they heard something that mad
part6370.0
e their hearts
stop -- a high, petrifie
part6371.0
d scream -- and it was coming from the 
part6372.0
chamber
they'd just chained up.

"Oh, n
part6373.0
o," said Ron, pale as the Bloody Baron.
part6374.0


"It's the girls' bathroom!" Harry gas
part6375.0
ped.

"Hermione!" they said together.


part6376.0
It was the last thing they wanted to do
part6377.0
, but what choice did they have?
Wheeli
part6378.0
ng around, they sprinted back to the do
part6379.0
or and turned the key,
fumbling in thei
part6380.0
r panic. Harry pulled the door open and
part6381.0
 they ran inside.

Hermione Granger was
part6382.0
 shrinking against the wall opposite, l
part6383.0
ooking as if
she was about to faint. Th
part6384.0
e troll was advancing on her, knocking 
part6385.0
the
sinks off the walls as it went.

"C
part6386.0
onfuse it!" Harry said desperately to R
part6387.0
on, and, seizing a tap, he
threw it as 
part6388.0
hard as he could against the wall.

The
part6389.0
 troll stopped a few feet from Hermione
part6390.0
. It lumbered around, blinking
stupidly
part6391.0
, to see what had made the noise. Its m
part6392.0
ean little eyes saw
Harry. It hesitated
part6393.0
, then made for him instead, lifting it
part6394.0
s club as it
went.

"Oy, pea-brain!" ye
part6395.0
lled Ron from the other side of the cha
part6396.0
mber, and he
threw a metal pipe at it. 
part6397.0
The troll didn't even seem to notice th
part6398.0
e pipe
hitting its shoulder, but it hea
part6399.0
rd the yell and paused again, turning
i
part6400.0
ts ugly snout toward Ron instead, givin
part6401.0
g Harry time to run around it.

"Come o
part6402.0
n, run, run!" Harry yelled at Hermione,
part6403.0
 trying to pull her toward
the door, bu
part6404.0
t she couldn't move, she was still flat
part6405.0
 against the wall,
her mouth open with 
part6406.0
terror.

The shouting and the echoes se
part6407.0
emed to be driving the troll berserk. I
part6408.0
t
roared again and started toward Ron, 
part6409.0
who was nearest and had no way to
escap
part6410.0
e.

Harry then did something that was b
part6411.0
oth very brave and very stupid: He
took
part6412.0
 a great running jump and managed to fa
part6413.0
sten his arms around the
troll's neck f
part6414.0
rom behind. The troll couldn't feel Har
part6415.0
ry hanging there,
but even a troll will
part6416.0
 notice if you stick a long bit of wood
part6417.0
 up its
nose, and Harry's wand had stil
part6418.0
l been in his hand when he'd jumped -- 
part6419.0
it
had gone straight up one of the trol
part6420.0
l's nostrils.

Howling with pain, the t
part6421.0
roll twisted and flailed its club, with
part6422.0
 Harry
clinging on for dear life; any s
part6423.0
econd, the troll was going to rip him
o
part6424.0
ff or catch him a terrible blow with th
part6425.0
e club.

Hermione had sunk to the floor
part6426.0
 in fright; Ron pulled out his own wand
part6427.0
 --
not knowing what he was going to do
part6428.0
 he heard himself cry the first spell
t
part6429.0
hat came into his head: "Wingardium Lev
part6430.0
iosa!"

The club flew suddenly out of t
part6431.0
he troll's hand, rose high, high up int
part6432.0
o
the air, turned slowly over -- and dr
part6433.0
opped, with a sickening crack, onto
its
part6434.0
 owner's head. The troll swayed on the 
part6435.0
spot and then fell flat on its
face, wi
part6436.0
th a thud that made the whole room trem
part6437.0
ble.

Harry got to his feet. He was sha
part6438.0
king and out of breath. Ron was
standin
part6439.0
g there with his wand still raised, sta
part6440.0
ring at what he had done.

It was Hermi
part6441.0
one who spoke first.

"Is it -- dead?"

part6442.0

I don't think so," said Harry, I think
part6443.0
 it's just been knocked out."

He bent 
part6444.0
down and pulled his wand out of the tro
part6445.0
ll's nose. It was covered
in what looke
part6446.0
d like lumpy gray glue.

"Urgh -- troll
part6447.0
 boogers."

He wiped it on the troll's 
part6448.0
trousers.

A sudden slamming and loud f
part6449.0
ootsteps made the three of them look up
part6450.0
.
They hadn't realized what a racket th
part6451.0
ey had been making, but of course,
some
part6452.0
one downstairs must have heard the cras
part6453.0
hes and the troll's roars. A
moment lat
part6454.0
er, Professor McGonagall had come burst
part6455.0
ing into the room,
closely followed by 
part6456.0
Snape, with Quirrell bringing up the re
part6457.0
ar. Quirrell
took one look at the troll
part6458.0
, let out a faint whimper, and sat quic
part6459.0
kly
down on a toilet, clutching his hea
part6460.0
rt.

Snape bent over the troll. Profess
part6461.0
or McGonagall was looking at Ron and
Ha
part6462.0
rry. Harry had never seen her look so a
part6463.0
ngry. Her lips were white.
Hopes of win
part6464.0
ning fifty points for Gryffindor faded 
part6465.0
quickly from Harry's
mind.

"What on ea
part6466.0
rth were you thinking of?" said Profess
part6467.0
or McGonagall, with
cold fury in her vo
part6468.0
ice. Harry looked at Ron, who was still
part6469.0
 standing with
his wand in the air. "Yo
part6470.0
u're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren
part6471.0
't you in
your dormitory?"

Snape gave 
part6472.0
Harry a swift, piercing look. Harry loo
part6473.0
ked at the floor. He
wished Ron would p
part6474.0
ut his wand down.

Then a small voice c
part6475.0
ame out of the shadows.

"Please, Profe
part6476.0
ssor McGonagall -- they were looking fo
part6477.0
r me."

"Miss Granger!"

Hermione had m
part6478.0
anaged to get to her feet at last.

I w
part6479.0
ent looking for the troll because I -- 
part6480.0
I thought I could deal with it
on my ow
part6481.0
n -- you know, because I've read all ab
part6482.0
out them."

Ron dropped his wand. Hermi
part6483.0
one Granger, telling a downright lie to
part6484.0
 a
teacher? "If they hadn't found me, I
part6485.0
'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand
up
part6486.0
 its nose and Ron knocked it out with i
part6487.0
ts own club. They didn't have
time to c
part6488.0
ome and fetch anyone. It was about to f
part6489.0
inish me off when they
arrived."

Harry
part6490.0
 and Ron tried to look as though this s
part6491.0
tory wasn't new to them.

"Well -- in t
part6492.0
hat case..." said Professor McGonagall,
part6493.0
 staring at the
three of them, "Miss Gr
part6494.0
anger, you foolish girl, how could you 
part6495.0
think of
tackling a mountain troll on y
part6496.0
our own?"

Hermione hung her head. Harr
part6497.0
y was speechless. Hermione was the last
part6498.0

person to do anything against the rule
part6499.0
s, and here she was, pretending
she had
part6500.0
, to get them out of trouble. It was as
part6501.0
 if Snape had started
handing out sweet
part6502.0
s.

"Miss Granger, five points will be 
part6503.0
taken from Gryffindor for this," said
P
part6504.0
rofessor McGonagall. "I'm very disappoi
part6505.0
nted in you. If you're not hurt
at all,
part6506.0
 you'd better get off to Gryffindor tow
part6507.0
er. Students are finishing
the feast in
part6508.0
 their houses."

Hermione left.

Profes
part6509.0
sor McGonagall turned to Harry and Ron.
part6510.0


"Well, I still say you were lucky, bu
part6511.0
t not many first years could have
taken
part6512.0
 on a full-grown mountain troll. You ea
part6513.0
ch win Gryffindor five
points. Professo
part6514.0
r Dumbledore will be informed of this. 
part6515.0
You may go."

They hurried out of the c
part6516.0
hamber and didn't speak at all until th
part6517.0
ey had
climbed two floors up. It was a 
part6518.0
relief to be away from the smell of the
part6519.0

troll, quite apart from anything else.
part6520.0


"We should have gotten more than ten 
part6521.0
points," Ron grumbled.

"Five, you mean
part6522.0
, once she's taken off Hermione's."

"G
part6523.0
ood of her to get us out of trouble lik
part6524.0
e that," Ron admitted. "Mind
you, we di
part6525.0
d save her."

"She might not have neede
part6526.0
d saving if we hadn't locked the thing 
part6527.0
in with
her," Harry reminded him.

They
part6528.0
 had reached the portrait of the Fat La
part6529.0
dy.

"Pig snout," they said and entered
part6530.0
.

The common room was packed and noisy
part6531.0
. Everyone was eating the food that
had
part6532.0
 been sent up. Hermione, however, stood
part6533.0
 alone by the door, waiting
for them. T
part6534.0
here was a very embarrassed pause. Then
part6535.0
, none of them looking
at each other, t
part6536.0
hey all said "Thanks," and hurried off 
part6537.0
to get plates.

But from that moment on
part6538.0
, Hermione Granger became their friend.
part6539.0
 There are
some things you can't share 
part6540.0
without ending up liking each other, an
part6541.0
d
knocking out a twelve-foot mountain t
part6542.0
roll is one of them.


CHAPTER ELEVEN


part6543.0
QUIDDITCH

As they entered November, th
part6544.0
e weather turned very cold. The mountai
part6545.0
ns
around the school became icy gray an
part6546.0
d the lake like chilled steel. Every
mo
part6547.0
rning the ground was covered in frost. 
part6548.0
Hagrid could be seen from the
upstairs 
part6549.0
windows defrosting broomsticks on the Q
part6550.0
uidditch field, bundled
up in a long mo
part6551.0
leskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and
part6552.0
 enormous
beaverskin boots.

The Quiddi
part6553.0
tch season had begun. On Saturday, Harr
part6554.0
y would be playing in
his first match a
part6555.0
fter weeks of training: Gryffindor vers
part6556.0
us Slytherin. If
Gryffindor won, they w
part6557.0
ould move up into second place in the h
part6558.0
ouse
championship.

Hardly anyone had s
part6559.0
een Harry play because Wood had decided
part6560.0
 that, as
their secret weapon, Harry sh
part6561.0
ould be kept, well, secret. But the new
part6562.0
s
that he was playing Seeker had leaked
part6563.0
 out somehow, and Harry didn't know
whi
part6564.0
ch was worse -- people telling him he'd
part6565.0
 be brilliant or people
telling him the
part6566.0
y'd be running around underneath him ho
part6567.0
lding a mattress.

It was really lucky 
part6568.0
that Harry now had Hermlone as a friend
part6569.0
. He didn't
know how he'd have gotten t
part6570.0
hrough all his homework without her, wh
part6571.0
at
with all the last-minute Quidditch p
part6572.0
ractice Wood was making them do. She
ha
part6573.0
d also tent him Quidditch Through the A
part6574.0
ges, which turned out to be a
very inte
part6575.0
resting read.

Harry learned that there
part6576.0
 were seven hundred ways of committing 
part6577.0
a
Quidditch foul and that all of them h
part6578.0
ad happened during a World Cup
match in
part6579.0
 1473; that Seekers were usually the sm
part6580.0
allest and fastest
players, and that mo
part6581.0
st serious Quidditch accidents seemed t
part6582.0
o happen to
them; that although people 
part6583.0
rarely died playing Quidditch, referees
part6584.0
 had
been known to vanish and turn up m
part6585.0
onths later in the Sahara Desert.

Herm
part6586.0
ione had become a bit more relaxed abou
part6587.0
t breaking rules since Harry
and Ron ha
part6588.0
d saved her from the mountain troll, an
part6589.0
d she was much nicer
for it. The day be
part6590.0
fore Harry's first Quidditch match the 
part6591.0
three of them
were out in the freezing 
part6592.0
courtyard during break, and she had con
part6593.0
jured
them up a bright blue fire that c
part6594.0
ould be carried around in a jam jar.
Th
part6595.0
ey were standing with their backs to it
part6596.0
, getting warm, when Snape
crossed the 
part6597.0
yard. Harry noticed at once that Snape 
part6598.0
was limping. Harry,
Ron, and Hermione m
part6599.0
oved closer together to block the fire 
part6600.0
from view;
they were sure it wouldn't b
part6601.0
e allowed. Unfortunately, something abo
part6602.0
ut
their guilty faces caught Snape's ey
part6603.0
e. He limped over. He hadn't seen
the f
part6604.0
ire, but he seemed to be looking for a 
part6605.0
reason to tell them off
anyway.

"What'
part6606.0
s that you've got there, Potter?"

It w
part6607.0
as Quidditch Through the Ages. Harry sh
part6608.0
owed him.

"Library books are not to be
part6609.0
 taken outside the school," said Snape.
part6610.0

"Give it to me. Five points from Gryff
part6611.0
indor."

"He's just made that rule up,"
part6612.0
 Harry muttered angrily as Snape limped
part6613.0

away. "Wonder what's wrong with his le
part6614.0
g?"

"Dunno, but I hope it's really hur
part6615.0
ting him," said Ron bitterly.

The Gryf
part6616.0
findor common room was very noisy that 
part6617.0
evening. Harry, Ron, and
Hermione sat t
part6618.0
ogether next to a window. Hermione was 
part6619.0
checking Harry and
Ron's Charms homewor
part6620.0
k for them. She would never let them co
part6621.0
py ("How will
you learn?"), but by aski
part6622.0
ng her to read it through, they got the
part6623.0
 right
answers anyway.

Harry felt rest
part6624.0
less. He wanted Quidditch Through the A
part6625.0
ges back, to take
his mind off his nerv
part6626.0
es about tomorrow. Why should he be afr
part6627.0
aid of
Snape? Getting up, he told Ron a
part6628.0
nd Hermione he was going to ask Snape i
part6629.0
f
he could have it.

"Better you than m
part6630.0
e," they said together, but Harry had a
part6631.0
n idea that
Snape wouldn't refuse if th
part6632.0
ere were other teachers listening.

He 
part6633.0
made his way down to the staffroom and 
part6634.0
knocked. There was no answer.
He knocke
part6635.0
d again. Nothing.

Perhaps Snape had le
part6636.0
ft the book in there? It was worth a tr
part6637.0
y. He pushed
the door ajar and peered i
part6638.0
nside -- and a horrible scene met his e
part6639.0
yes.

Snape and Filch were inside, alon
part6640.0
e. Snape was holding his robes above
hi
part6641.0
s knees. One of his legs was bloody and
part6642.0
 mangled. Filch was handing
Snape banda
part6643.0
ges.

"Blasted thing*," Snape was sayin
part6644.0
g. "How are you supposed to keep your
e
part6645.0
yes on all three heads at once?"

Harry
part6646.0
 tried to shut the door quietly, but --
part6647.0


"POTTER!"

Snape's face was twisted w
part6648.0
ith fury as he dropped his robes quickl
part6649.0
y to
hide his leg. Harry gulped.

"I ju
part6650.0
st wondered if I could have my book bac
part6651.0
k."

"GET OUT! OUT!"

Harry left, befor
part6652.0
e Snape could take any more points from
part6653.0
 Gryffindor. He
sprinted back upstairs.
part6654.0


"Did you get it?" Ron asked as Harry 
part6655.0
joined them. "What's the matter?"

In a
part6656.0
 low whisper, Harry told them what he'd
part6657.0
 seen.

"You know what this means?" he 
part6658.0
finished breathlessly. "He tried to get
part6659.0

past that three-headed dog at Hallowee
part6660.0
n! That's where he was going when
we sa
part6661.0
w him -- he's after whatever it's guard
part6662.0
ing! And Id bet my
broomstick he let th
part6663.0
at troll in, to make a diversion!"

Her
part6664.0
mione's eyes were wide.

"No -- he woul
part6665.0
dn't, she said. "I know he's not very n
part6666.0
ice, but he
wouldn't try and steal some
part6667.0
thing Dumbledore was keeping safe."

"H
part6668.0
onestly, Hermione, you think all teache
part6669.0
rs are saints or something,"
snapped Ro
part6670.0
n. "I'm with Harry. I wouldn't put anyt
part6671.0
hing past Snape. But
what's he after? W
part6672.0
hat's that dog guarding?"

Harry went t
part6673.0
o bed with his head buzzing with the sa
part6674.0
me question. Neville
was snoring loudly
part6675.0
, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried to
part6676.0
 empty his mind
-- he needed to sleep, 
part6677.0
he had to, he had his first Quidditch m
part6678.0
atch in a
few hours -- but the expressi
part6679.0
on on Snape's face when Harry had seen 
part6680.0
his
leg wasn't easy to forget.

The nex
part6681.0
t morning dawned very bright and cold. 
part6682.0
The Great Hall was full of
the deliciou
part6683.0
s smell of fried sausages and the cheer
part6684.0
 ful chatter of
everyone looking forwar
part6685.0
d to a good Quidditch match.

"You've g
part6686.0
ot to eat some breakfast."

"I don't wa
part6687.0
nt anything."

"Just a bit of toast," w
part6688.0
heedled Hermione.

"I'm not hungry."

H
part6689.0
arry felt terrible. In an hour's time h
part6690.0
e'd be walking onto the field.

"Harry,
part6691.0
 you need your strength," said Seamus F
part6692.0
innigan. "Seekers are
always the ones w
part6693.0
ho get clobbered by the other team."

"
part6694.0
Thanks, Seamus," said Harry, watching S
part6695.0
eamus pile ketchup on his
sausages.

By
part6696.0
 eleven o'clock the whole school seemed
part6697.0
 to be out in the stands around
the Qui
part6698.0
dditch pitch. Many students had binocul
part6699.0
ars. The seats might be
raised high in 
part6700.0
the air, but it was still difficult to 
part6701.0
see what was going
on sometimes.

Ron a
part6702.0
nd Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and
part6703.0
 Dean the West Ham fan up in
the top ro
part6704.0
w. As a surprise for Harry, they had pa
part6705.0
inted a large banner on
one of the shee
part6706.0
ts Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter 
part6707.0
for President, and
Dean, who was good a
part6708.0
t drawing, had done a large Gryffindor 
part6709.0
lion
underneath. Then Hermione had perf
part6710.0
ormed a tricky little charm so that
the
part6711.0
 paint flashed different colors.

Meanw
part6712.0
hile, in the locker room, Harry and the
part6713.0
 rest of the team were
changing into th
part6714.0
eir scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin 
part6715.0
would be playing
in green).

Wood clear
part6716.0
ed his throat for silence.

"Okay, men,
part6717.0
" he said.

"And women," said Chaser An
part6718.0
gelina Johnson.

"And women," Wood agre
part6719.0
ed. "This is it."

"The big one," said 
part6720.0
Fred Weasley.

"The one we've all been 
part6721.0
waiting for," said George.

"We know Ol
part6722.0
iver's speech by heart," Fred told Harr
part6723.0
y, "we were on the
team last year."

"S
part6724.0
hut up, you two," said Wood. "This is t
part6725.0
he best team Gryffindor's had
in years.
part6726.0
 We're going to win. I know it."

He gl
part6727.0
ared at them all as if to say, "Or else
part6728.0
."

"Right. It's time. Good luck, all o
part6729.0
f you."

Harry followed Fred and George
part6730.0
 out of the locker room and, hoping his
part6731.0

knees weren't going to give way, walke
part6732.0
d onto the field to loud cheers.

Madam
part6733.0
 Hooch was refereeing. She stood in the
part6734.0
 middle of the field waiting
for the tw
part6735.0
o teams, her broom in her hand.

"Now, 
part6736.0
I want a nice fair game, all of you," s
part6737.0
he said, once they were all
gathered ar
part6738.0
ound her. Harry noticed that she seemed
part6739.0
 to be speaking
particularly to the Sly
part6740.0
therin Captain, Marcus Flint, a sixth y
part6741.0
ear. Harry
thought Flint looked as if h
part6742.0
e had some troll blood in him. Out of t
part6743.0
he
corner of his eye he saw the flutter
part6744.0
ing banner high above, flashing
Potter 
part6745.0
for President over the crowd. His heart
part6746.0
 skipped. He felt braver.

"Mount your 
part6747.0
brooms, please."

Harry clambered onto 
part6748.0
his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Madam Hooch g
part6749.0
ave a loud blast on her silver whistle.
part6750.0


Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high in
part6751.0
to the air. They were off. "And the
Qua
part6752.0
ffle is taken immediately by Angelina J
part6753.0
ohnson of Gryffindor -- what
an excelle
part6754.0
nt Chaser that girl is, and rather attr
part6755.0
active, too --"

"JORDAN!"

"Sorry, Pro
part6756.0
fessor."

The Weasley twins' friend, Le
part6757.0
e Jordan, was doing the commentary for 
part6758.0
the
match, closely watched by Professor
part6759.0
 McGonagall.

"And she's really belting

Gryff
part6787.0
indor cheers filled the cold air, with 
part6788.0
howls and moans from the
Slytherins.

"
part6789.0
Budge up there, move along."

"Hagrid!"
part6790.0


Ron and Hermione squeezed together to
part6791.0
 give Hagrid enough space to join
them.
part6792.0


"Bin watchin' from me hut," said Hagr
part6793.0
id, patting a large pair of
binoculars 
part6794.0
around his neck, "But it isn't the same
part6795.0
 as bein' in the
crowd. No sign of the 
part6796.0
Snitch yet, eh?"

"Nope," said Ron. "Ha
part6797.0
rry hasn't had much to do yet."

"Kept 
part6798.0
outta trouble, though, that's somethin'
part6799.0
," said Hagrid, raising his
binoculars 
part6800.0
and peering skyward at the speck that w
part6801.0
as Harry.

Way up above them, Harry was
part6802.0
 gliding over the game, squinting about
part6803.0
 for
some sign of the Snitch. This was 
part6804.0
part of his and Wood's game plan.

"Kee
part6805.0
p out of the way until you catch sight 
part6806.0
of the Snitch," Wood had
said. "We don'
part6807.0
t want you attacked before you have to 
part6808.0
be."

When Angelina had scored, Harry h
part6809.0
ad done a couple of loop-the-loops to
l
part6810.0
et off his feelings. Now he was back to
part6811.0
 staring around for the Snitch.
Once he
part6812.0
 caught sight of a flash of gold, but i
part6813.0
t was just a reflection
from one of the
part6814.0
 Weasleys' wristwatches, and once a Blu
part6815.0
dger decided to
come pelting his way, m
part6816.0
ore like a cannonball than anything, bu
part6817.0
t Harry
dodged it and Fred Weasley came
part6818.0
 chasing after it.

"All right there, H
part6819.0
arry?" he had time to yell, as he beat 
part6820.0
the Bludger
furiously toward Marcus Fli
part6821.0
nt.

"Slytherin in possession," Lee Jor
part6822.0
dan was saying, "Chaser Pucey ducks
two
part6823.0
 Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bel
part6824.0
l, and speeds toward the --
wait a mome
part6825.0
nt -- was that the Snitch?"

A murmur r
part6826.0
an through the crowd as Adrian Pucey dr
part6827.0
opped the Quaffle, too
busy looking ove
part6828.0
r his shoulder at the flash of gold tha
part6829.0
t had passed his
left ear.

Harry saw i
part6830.0
t. In a great rush of excitement he div
part6831.0
ed downward after the
streak of gold. S
part6832.0
lytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen 
part6833.0
it, too. Neck
and neck they hurtled tow
part6834.0
ard the Snitch -all the Chasers seemed 
part6835.0
to have
forgotten what they were suppos
part6836.0
ed to be doing as they hung in midair t
part6837.0
o
watch.

Harry was faster than Higgs -
part6838.0
- he could see the little round ball, w
part6839.0
ings
fluttering, darting up ahead - - h
part6840.0
e put on an extra spurt of speed --

WH
part6841.0
AM! A roar of rage echoed from the Gryf
part6842.0
findors below -- Marcus Flint
had block
part6843.0
ed Harry on purpose, and Harry's broom 
part6844.0
spun off course, Harry
holding on for d
part6845.0
ear life.

"Foul!" screamed the Gryffin
part6846.0
dors.

Madam Hooch spoke angrily to Fli
part6847.0
nt and then ordered a free shot at the

part6848.0
goal posts for Gryffindor. But in all t
part6849.0
he confusion, of course, the
Golden Sni
part6850.0
tch had disappeared from sight again.


part6851.0
Down in the stands, Dean Thomas was yel
part6852.0
ling, "Send him off, ref! Red
card!"

"
part6853.0
What are you talking about, Dean?" said
part6854.0
 Ron.

"Red card!" said Dean furiously.
part6855.0
 "In soccer you get shown the red card

part6856.0
and you're out of the game!"

"But this
part6857.0
 isn't soccer, Dean," Ron reminded him.
part6858.0


Hagrid, however, was on Dean's side.

part6859.0

"They oughta change the rules. Flint c
part6860.0
oulda knocked Harry outta the
air."

Le
part6861.0
e Jordan was finding it difficult not t
part6862.0
o take sides.

"So -- after that obviou
part6863.0
s and disgusting bit of cheating

"Jord
part6864.0
an!" growled Professor McGonagall.

"I 
part6865.0
mean, after that open and revolting fou
part6866.0
l

'Jordan, I'm warning you --"

"All r
part6867.0
ight, all right. Flint nearly kills the
part6868.0
 Gryffindor Seeker, which
could happen 
part6869.0
to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gr
part6870.0
yffindor, taken by
Spinner, who puts it
part6871.0
 away, no trouble, and we continue play
part6872.0
, Gryffindor
still in possession."

It 
part6873.0
was as Harry dodged another Bludger, wh
part6874.0
ich went spinning dangerously
past his 
part6875.0
head, that it happened. His broom gave 
part6876.0
a sudden, frightening
lurch. For a spli
part6877.0
t second, he thought he was going to fa
part6878.0
ll. He gripped
the broom tightly with b
part6879.0
oth his hands and knees. He'd never fel
part6880.0
t
anything like that.

It happened agai
part6881.0
n. It was as though the broom was tryin
part6882.0
g to buck him
off. But Nimbus Two Thous
part6883.0
ands did not suddenly decide to buck th
part6884.0
eir
riders off. Harry tried to turn bac
part6885.0
k toward the Gryffindor goal- posts
-- 
part6886.0
he had half a mind to ask Wood to call 
part6887.0
time-out -- and then he
realized that h
part6888.0
is broom was completely out of his cont
part6889.0
rol. He couldn't
turn it. He couldn't d
part6890.0
irect it at all. It was zigzagging thro
part6891.0
ugh the
air, and every now and then mak
part6892.0
ing violent swishing movements that
alm
part6893.0
ost unseated him.

Lee was still commen
part6894.0
tating.

"Slytherin in possession -- Fl
part6895.0
int with the Quaffle -- passes Spinnet 
part6896.0
--
passes Bell -- hit hard in the face 
part6897.0
by a Bludger, hope it broke his nose
--
part6898.0
 only joking, Professor -- Slytherins s
part6899.0
core -- A no...

The Slytherins were ch
part6900.0
eering. No one seemed to have noticed t
part6901.0
hat Harry's
broom was behaving strangel
part6902.0
y. It was carrying- him slowly higher, 
part6903.0
away
from the game, jerking and twitchi
part6904.0
ng as it went.

"Dunno what Harry think
part6905.0
s he's doing," Hagrid mumbled. He stare
part6906.0
d through
his binoculars. "If I didn' k
part6907.0
now better, I'd say he'd lost control o
part6908.0
f
his broom... but he can't have...."


part6909.0
Suddenly, people were pointing up at Ha
part6910.0
rry all over the stands. His
broom had 
part6911.0
started to roll over and over, with him
part6912.0
 only just managing to
hold on. Then th
part6913.0
e whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had
part6914.0
 given a wild
jerk and Harry swung off 
part6915.0
it. He was now dangling from it, holdin
part6916.0
g on
with only one hand.

"Did somethin
part6917.0
g happen to it when Flint blocked him?"
part6918.0
 Seamus whispered.

"Can't have," Hagri
part6919.0
d said, his voice shaking. "Can't nothi
part6920.0
ng interfere
with a broomstick except p
part6921.0
owerful Dark magic -- no kid could do t
part6922.0
hat to
a Nimbus Two Thousand."

At thes
part6923.0
e words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoc
part6924.0
ulars, but instead of
looking up at Har
part6925.0
ry, she started looking frantically at 
part6926.0
the crowd.

"What are you doing?" moane
part6927.0
d Ron, gray-faced.

"I knew it," Hermio
part6928.0
ne gasped, "Snape -- look."

Ron grabbe
part6929.0
d the binoculars. Snape was in the midd
part6930.0
le of the stands
opposite them. He had 
part6931.0
his eyes fixed on Harry and was mutteri
part6932.0
ng nonstop
under his breath.

"He's doi
part6933.0
ng something -- jinxing the broom," sai
part6934.0
d Hermione.

"What should we do?"

"Lea
part6935.0
ve it to me."

Before Ron could say ano
part6936.0
ther word, Hermione had disappeared. Ro
part6937.0
n turned
the binoculars back on Harry. 
part6938.0
His broom was vibrating so hard, it was
part6939.0

almost impossible for him to hang on m
part6940.0
uch longer. The whole crowd was on
its 
part6941.0
feet, watching, terrified, as the Weasl
part6942.0
eys flew up to try and pull
Harry safel
part6943.0
y onto one of their brooms, but it was 
part6944.0
no good -- every time
they got near him
part6945.0
, the broom would jump higher still. Th
part6946.0
ey dropped lower
and circled beneath hi
part6947.0
m, obviously hoping to catch him if he 
part6948.0
fell.
Marcus

Flint seized the Quaffle 
part6949.0
and scored five times without anyone no
part6950.0
ticing.

"Come on, Hermione," Ron mutte
part6951.0
red desperately.

Hermione had fought h
part6952.0
er way across to the stand where Snape 
part6953.0
stood, and
was now racing along the row
part6954.0
 behind him; she didn't even stop to sa
part6955.0
y
sorry as she knocked Professor Quirre
part6956.0
ll headfirst into the row in front.
Rea
part6957.0
ching Snape, she crouched down, pulled 
part6958.0
out her wand, and whispered a
few, well
part6959.0
- chosen words. Bright blue flames shot
part6960.0
 from her wand onto the
hem of Snape's 
part6961.0
robes.

It took perhaps thirty seconds 
part6962.0
for Snape to realize that he was on fir
part6963.0
e.
A sudden yelp told her she had done 
part6964.0
her job. Scooping the fire off him
into
part6965.0
 a little jar in her pocket, she scramb
part6966.0
led back along the row --
Snape would n
part6967.0
ever know what had happened.

It was en
part6968.0
ough. Up in the air, Harry was suddenly
part6969.0
 able to clamber back on
to his broom.

part6970.0

"Neville, you can look!" Ron said. Nev
part6971.0
ille had been sobbing into
Hagrid's jac
part6972.0
ket for the last five minutes.

Harry w
part6973.0
as speeding toward the ground when the 
part6974.0
crowd saw him clap his
hand to his mout
part6975.0
h as though he was about to be sick -- 
part6976.0
he hit the field
on all fours -- coughe
part6977.0
d -- and something gold fell into his h
part6978.0
and.

"I've got the Snitch!" he shouted
part6979.0
, waving it above his head, and the
gam
part6980.0
e ended in complete confusion.

"He did
part6981.0
n't catch it, he nearly swallowed it," 
part6982.0
Flint was still howling
twenty minutes 
part6983.0
later, but it made no difference -- Har
part6984.0
ry hadn't broken
any rules and Lee Jord
part6985.0
an was still happily shouting the resul
part6986.0
ts --
Gryffindor had won by one hundred
part6987.0
 and seventy points to sixty. Harry
hea
part6988.0
rd none of this, though. He was being m
part6989.0
ade a cup of strong tea back
in Hagrid'
part6990.0
s hut, with Ron and Hermione.

"It was 
part6991.0
Snape," Ron was explaining, "Hermione a
part6992.0
nd I saw him. He was
cursing your broom
part6993.0
stick, muttering, he wouldn't take his 
part6994.0
eyes off you."

"Rubbish," said Hagrid,
part6995.0
 who hadn't heard a word of what had go
part6996.0
ne on next
to him in the stands. "Why w
part6997.0
ould Snape do somethin' like that?"

Ha
part6998.0
rry, Ron, and Hermione looked at one an
part6999.0
other, wondering what to tell
him. Harr
part7000.0
y decided on the truth.

"I found out s
part7001.0
omething about him," he told Hagrid. "H
part7002.0
e tried to get past
that three-headed d
part7003.0
og on Halloween. It bit him. We think h
part7004.0
e was trying
to steal whatever it's gua
part7005.0
rding."

Hagrid dropped the teapot.

"H
part7006.0
ow do you know about Fluffy?" he said.

part7007.0

"Fluffy?"

"Yeah -- he's mine -- bough
part7008.0
t him off a Greek chappie I met in the 
part7009.0
pub
las' year -- I lent him to Dumbledo
part7010.0
re to guard the

"Yes?" said Harry eage
part7011.0
rly.

"Now, don't ask me anymore," said
part7012.0
 Hagrid gruffly. "That's top secret,
th
part7013.0
at is."

"But Snape's trying to steal i
part7014.0
t."

"Rubbish," said Hagrid again. "Sna
part7015.0
pe's a Hogwarts teacher, he'd do
nothin
part7016.0
' of the sort."

"So why did he just tr
part7017.0
y and kill Harry?" cried Hermione.

The
part7018.0
 afternoon's events certainly seemed to
part7019.0
 have changed her mind about
Snape.

I 
part7020.0
know a jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I'v
part7021.0
e read all about them!

You've got to k
part7022.0
eep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blink
part7023.0
ing at all, I saw
him!"

"I'm tellin' y
part7024.0
eh, yer wrong!" said Hagrid hotly. "I d
part7025.0
on' know why
Harry's broom acted like t
part7026.0
hat, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill a s
part7027.0
tudent!
Now, listen to me, all three of
part7028.0
 yeh -- yer meddlin' in things that don
part7029.0
'
concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forg
part7030.0
et that dog, an' you forget what
it's g
part7031.0
uardin', that's between Professor Dumbl
part7032.0
edore an' Nicolas Flamel
--"

"Aha!" sa
part7033.0
id Harry, "so there's someone called Ni
part7034.0
colas Flamel involved,
is there?"

Hagr
part7035.0
id looked furious with himself.

THE MIRROR OF ERISED

Christ
part7037.0
mas was coming. One morning in mid-Dece
part7038.0
mber, Hogwarts woke to find
itself cove
part7039.0
red in several feet of snow. The lake f
part7040.0
roze solid and the
Weasley twins were p
part7041.0
unished for bewitching several snowball
part7042.0
s so that
they followed Quirrell around
part7043.0
, bouncing off the back of his turban. 
part7044.0
The
few owls that managed to battle the
part7045.0
ir way through the stormy sky to
delive
part7046.0
r mail had to be nursed back to health 
part7047.0
by Hagrid before they could
fly off aga
part7048.0
in.

No one could wait for the holidays
part7049.0
 to start. While the Gryffindor common

part7050.0
room and the Great Hall had roaring fir
part7051.0
es, the drafty corridors had
become icy
part7052.0
 and a bitter wind rattled the windows 
part7053.0
in the classrooms.
Worst of all were Pr
part7054.0
ofessor Snape's classes down in the dun
part7055.0
geons, where
their breath rose in a mis
part7056.0
t before them and they kept as close as
part7057.0

possible to their hot cauldrons.

"I d
part7058.0
o feel so sorry," said Draco Malfoy, on
part7059.0
e Potions class, "for all
those people 
part7060.0
who have to stay at Hogwarts for Christ
part7061.0
mas because they're
not wanted at home.
part7062.0
"

He was looking over at Harry as he s
part7063.0
poke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled.
Harry,
part7064.0
 who was measuring out powdered spine o
part7065.0
f lionfish, ignored them.
Malfoy had be
part7066.0
en even more unpleasant than usual sinc
part7067.0
e the Quidditch
match. Disgusted that t
part7068.0
he Slytherins had lost, he had tried to
part7069.0
 get
everyone laughing at how a wide-mo
part7070.0
uthed tree frog would be replacing
Harr
part7071.0
y as Seeker next. Then he'd realized th
part7072.0
at nobody found this funny,
because the
part7073.0
y were all so impressed at the way Harr
part7074.0
y had managed to stay
on his bucking br
part7075.0
oomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry,
part7076.0
 had gone back
to taunting Harry about 
part7077.0
having no proper family.

It was true t
part7078.0
hat Harry wasn't going back to Privet D
part7079.0
rive for Christmas.
Professor McGonagal
part7080.0
l had come around the week before, maki
part7081.0
ng a list of
students who would be stay
part7082.0
ing for the holidays, and Harry had sig
part7083.0
ned up
at once. He didn't feel sorry fo
part7084.0
r himself at all; this would probably b
part7085.0
e
the best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron
part7086.0
 and his brothers were staying,
too, be
part7087.0
cause Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going t
part7088.0
o Romania to visit
Charlie.

When they 
part7089.0
left the dungeons at the end of Potions
part7090.0
, they found a large
fir tree blocking 
part7091.0
the corridor ahead. Two enormous feet s
part7092.0
ticking out at
the bottom and a loud pu
part7093.0
ffing sound told them that Hagrid was b
part7094.0
ehind it.

"Hi, Hagrid, want any help?"
part7095.0
 Ron asked, sticking his head through t
part7096.0
he
branches.

"Nah, I'm all right, than
part7097.0
ks, Ron."

"Would you mind moving out o
part7098.0
f the way?" came Malfoys cold drawl fro
part7099.0
m
behind them. "Are you trying to earn 
part7100.0
some extra money, Weasley? Hoping
to be
part7101.0
 gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hog
part7102.0
warts, I suppose -- that hut
of Hagrid'
part7103.0
s must seem like a palace compared to w
part7104.0
hat your family's used
to."

Ron dived 
part7105.0
at Malfoy just as Snape came up the sta
part7106.0
irs.

"WEASLEY!"

Ron let go of the fro
part7107.0
nt of Malfoy's robes.

"He was provoked
part7108.0
, Professor Snape," said Hagrid, sticki
part7109.0
ng his huge hairy
face out from behind 
part7110.0
the tree. "Malfoy was insultin' his fam
part7111.0
ily."

"Be that as it may, fighting is 
part7112.0
against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid," said
S
part7113.0
nape silkily. "Five points from Gryffin
part7114.0
dor, Weasley, and be grateful it
isn't 
part7115.0
more. Move along, all of you."

Malfoy,
part7116.0
 Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past 
part7117.0
the tree, scattering
needles everywhere
part7118.0
 and smirking.

"I'll get him," said Ro
part7119.0
n, grinding his teeth at Malfoy's back,
part7120.0
 "one of
these days, I'll get him --"


part7121.0
"I hate them both," said Harry, "Malfoy
part7122.0
 and Snape."

"Come on, cheer up, it's 
part7123.0
nearly Christmas," said Hagrid. "Tell y
part7124.0
eh what,
come with me an' see the Great
part7125.0
 Hall, looks a treat."

So the three of
part7126.0
 them followed Hagrid and his tree off 
part7127.0
to -the Great
Hall, where Professor McG
part7128.0
onagall and Professor Flitwick were bus
part7129.0
y with
the Christmas decorations.

"Ah,
part7130.0
 Hagrid, the last tree -- put it in the
part7131.0
 far corner, would you?"

The hall look
part7132.0
ed spectacular. Festoons of holly and m
part7133.0
istletoe hung all
around the walls, and
part7134.0
 no less than twelve towering Christmas
part7135.0
 trees stood
around the room, some spar
part7136.0
kling with tiny icicles, some glitterin
part7137.0
g with
hundreds of candles.

"How many 
part7138.0
days you got left until yer holidays?" 
part7139.0
Hagrid asked.

"Just one," said Hermion
part7140.0
e. "And that reminds me -Harry, Ron, we
part7141.0
've got
half an hour before lunch, we s
part7142.0
hould be in the library."

"Oh yeah, yo
part7143.0
u're right," said Ron, tearing his eyes
part7144.0
 away from Professor
Flitwick, who had 
part7145.0
golden bubbles blossoming out of his wa
part7146.0
nd and was
trailing them over the branc
part7147.0
hes of the new tree.

"The library?" sa
part7148.0
id Hagrid, following them out of the ha
part7149.0
ll. "Just before
the holidays? Bit keen
part7150.0
, aren't yeh?"

"Oh, we're not working,
part7151.0
" Harry told him brightly. "Ever since 
part7152.0
you
mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been
part7153.0
 trying to find out who he is."

"You w
part7154.0
hat?" Hagrid looked shocked. "Listen he
part7155.0
re -- I've told yeh -- drop
it. It's no
part7156.0
thin' to you what that dog's guardin'."
part7157.0


"We just want to know who Nicolas Fla
part7158.0
mel is, that's all," said Hermione.

"U
part7159.0
nless you'd like to tell us and save us
part7160.0
 the trouble?" Harry added. "We
must've
part7161.0
 been through hundreds of books already
part7162.0
 and we can't find him
anywhere -- just
part7163.0
 give us a hint -- I know I've read his
part7164.0
 name somewhere."

"I'm sayin' nothin, 
part7165.0
said Hagrid flatly.

"Just have to find
part7166.0
 out for ourselves, then," said Ron, an
part7167.0
d they left
Hagrid looking disgruntled 
part7168.0
and hurried off to the library.

They h
part7169.0
ad indeed been searching books for Flam
part7170.0
el's name ever since Hagrid
had let it 
part7171.0
slip, because how else were they going 
part7172.0
to find out what Snape
was trying to st
part7173.0
eal? The trouble was, it was very hard 
part7174.0
to know where to
begin, not knowing wha
part7175.0
t Flamel might have done to get himself
part7176.0
 into a
book. He wasn't in Great Wizard
part7177.0
s of the Twentieth Century, or Notable

part7178.0
Magical Names of Our Time; he was missi
part7179.0
ng, too, from Important Modern
Magical 
part7180.0
Discoveries, and A Study of Recent Deve
part7181.0
lopments in Wizardry. And
then, of cour
part7182.0
se, there was the sheer size of the lib
part7183.0
rary; tens of
thousands of books; thous
part7184.0
ands of shelves; hundreds of narrow row
part7185.0
s.

Hermione took out a list of subject
part7186.0
s and titles she had decided to
search 
part7187.0
while Ron strode off down a row of book
part7188.0
s and started pulling them
off the shel
part7189.0
ves at random. Harry wandered over to t
part7190.0
he Restricted
Section. He had been wond
part7191.0
ering for a while if Flamel wasn't some
part7192.0
where in
there. Unfortunately, you need
part7193.0
ed a specially signed note from one of 
part7194.0
the
teachers to look in any of the rest
part7195.0
ricted books, and he knew he'd never
ge
part7196.0
t one. These were the books containing 
part7197.0
powerful Dark Magic never
taught at Hog
part7198.0
warts, and only read by older students 
part7199.0
studying advanced
Defense Against the D
part7200.0
ark Arts.

"What are you looking for, b
part7201.0
oy?"

"Nothing," said Harry.

Madam Pin
part7202.0
ce the librarian brandished a feather d
part7203.0
uster at him.

"You'd better get out, t
part7204.0
hen. Go on -- out!"

Wishing he'd been 
part7205.0
a bit quicker at thinking up some story
part7206.0
, Harry left
the library. He, Ron, and 
part7207.0
Hermione had already agreed they'd bett
part7208.0
er not
ask Madam Pince where they could
part7209.0
 find Flamel. They were sure she'd be
a
part7210.0
ble to tell them, but they couldn't ris
part7211.0
k Snape hearing what they were
up to.


part7212.0
Harry waited outside in the corridor to
part7213.0
 see if the other two had found
anythin
part7214.0
g, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had
part7215.0
 been looking for two
weeks, after A, b
part7216.0
ut as they only had odd moments between
part7217.0
 lessons it
wasn't surprising they'd fo
part7218.0
und nothing. What they really needed wa
part7219.0
s a
nice long search without Madam Pinc
part7220.0
e breathing down their necks.

Five min
part7221.0
utes later, Ron and Hermione joined him
part7222.0
, shaking their heads.
They went off to
part7223.0
 lunch.

"You will keep looking while I
part7224.0
'm away, won't you?" said Hermione. "An
part7225.0
d
send me an owl if you find anything."
part7226.0


"And you could ask your parents if th
part7227.0
ey know who Flamel is," said Ron.
"It'd
part7228.0
 be safe to ask them."

"Very safe, as 
part7229.0
they're both dentists," said Hermione.

part7230.0

Once the holidays had started, Ron and
part7231.0
 Harry were having too good a time
to t
part7232.0
hink much about Flamel. They had the do
part7233.0
rmitory to themselves and the
common ro
part7234.0
om was far emptier than usual, so they 
part7235.0
were able to get the
good armchairs by 
part7236.0
the fire. They sat by the hour eating a
part7237.0
nything they
could spear on a toasting 
part7238.0
fork -- bread, English muffins, marshma
part7239.0
llows
-- and plotting ways of getting M
part7240.0
alfoy expelled, which were fun to talk

part7241.0
about even if they wouldn't work.

Ron 
part7242.0
also started teaching Harry wizard ches
part7243.0
s. This was exactly like
Muggle chess e
part7244.0
xcept that the figures were alive, whic
part7245.0
h made it a lot
like directing troops i
part7246.0
n battle. Ron's set was very old and ba
part7247.0
ttered.
Like everything else he owned, 
part7248.0
it had once belonged to someone else in
part7249.0

his family -- in this case, his grandf
part7250.0
ather. However, old chessmen
weren't a 
part7251.0
drawback at all. Ron knew them so well 
part7252.0
he never had trouble
getting them to do
part7253.0
 what he wanted.

Harry played with che
part7254.0
ssmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and
part7255.0
 they didn't
trust him at all. He wasn'
part7256.0
t a very good player yet and they kept

part7257.0
shouting different bits of advice at hi
part7258.0
m, which was confusing. "Don't
send me 
part7259.0
there, can't you see his knight? Send h
part7260.0
im, we can afford to lose
him." On Chri
part7261.0
stmas Eve, Harry went to bed looking fo
part7262.0
rward to the next
day for the food and 
part7263.0
the fun, but not expecting any presents
part7264.0
 at all.
When he woke early in the morn
part7265.0
ing, however, the first thing he saw wa
part7266.0
s a
small pile of packages at the foot 
part7267.0
of his bed.

"Merry Christmas," said Ro
part7268.0
n sleepily as Harry scrambled out of be
part7269.0
d and
pulled on his bathrobe.

"You, to
part7270.0
o," said Harry. "Will you look at this?
part7271.0
 I've got some presents!"

"What did yo
part7272.0
u expect, turnips?" said Ron, turning t
part7273.0
o his own pile, which
was a lot bigger 
part7274.0
than Harry's.

Harry picked up the top 
part7275.0
parcel. It was wrapped in thick brown p
part7276.0
aper and
scrawled across it was To Harr
part7277.0
y, from Hagrid. Inside was a roughly cu
part7278.0
t
wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously wh
part7279.0
ittled it himself. Harry blew it --
it 
part7280.0
sounded a bit like an owl.

A second, v
part7281.0
ery small parcel contained a note.

We 
part7282.0
received your message and enclose your 
part7283.0
Christmas present. From Uncle
Vernon an
part7284.0
d Aunt Petunia. Taped to the note was a
part7285.0
 fifty-pence piece.

"That's friendly,"
part7286.0
 said Harry.

Ron was fascinated by the
part7287.0
 fifty pence.

"Weird!" he said, 'NMat 
part7288.0
a shape! This is money?"

"You can keep
part7289.0
 it," said Harry, laughing at how pleas
part7290.0
ed Ron was. "Hagrid
and my aunt and unc
part7291.0
le -- so who sent these?"

"I think I k
part7292.0
now who that one's from," said Ron, tur
part7293.0
ning a bit pink and
pointing to a very 
part7294.0
lumpy parcel. "My mom. I told her you d
part7295.0
idn't expect
any presents and -- oh, no
part7296.0
," he groaned, "she's made you a Weasle
part7297.0
y
sweater."

Harry had torn open the pa
part7298.0
rcel to find a thick, hand-knitted swea
part7299.0
ter in
emerald green and a large box of
part7300.0
 homemade fudge.

"Every year she makes
part7301.0
 us a sweater," said Ron, unwrapping hi
part7302.0
s own, "and
mine's always maroon."

"Th
part7303.0
at's really nice of her," said Harry, t
part7304.0
rying the fudge, which was
very tasty.

part7305.0

His next present also contained candy 
part7306.0
-- a large box of Chocolate Frogs
from 
part7307.0
Hermione.

This only left one parcel. H
part7308.0
arry picked it up and felt it. It was v
part7309.0
ery
light. He unwrapped it.

Something 
part7310.0
fluid and silvery gray went slithering 
part7311.0
to the floor where it
lay in gleaming f
part7312.0
olds. Ron gasped.

"I've heard of those
part7313.0
," he said in a hushed voice, dropping 
part7314.0
the box of
Every Flavor Beans he'd gott
part7315.0
en from Hermione. "If that's what I thi
part7316.0
nk it
is -- they're really rare, and re
part7317.0
ally valuable."

"What is it?"

Harry p
part7318.0
icked the shining, silvery cloth off th
part7319.0
e floor. It was strange to
the touch, l
part7320.0
ike water woven into material.

"It's a
part7321.0
n invisibility cloak," said Ron, a look
part7322.0
 of awe on his face. "I'm
sure it is --
part7323.0
 try it on."

Harry threw the cloak aro
part7324.0
und his shoulders and Ron gave a yell.

part7325.0

"It is! Look down!"

Harry looked down
part7326.0
 at his feet, but they were gone. He da
part7327.0
shed to the
mirror. Sure enough, his re
part7328.0
flection looked back at him, just his h
part7329.0
ead
suspended in midair, his body compl
part7330.0
etely invisible. He pulled the cloak
ov
part7331.0
er his head and his reflection vanished
part7332.0
 completely.

"There's a note!" said Ro
part7333.0
n suddenly. "A note fell out of it!"

H
part7334.0
arry pulled off the cloak and seized th
part7335.0
e letter. Written in narrow,
loopy writ
part7336.0
ing he had never seen before were the f
part7337.0
ollowing words: Your
father left this i
part7338.0
n my possession before he died. It is t
part7339.0
ime it was
returned to you. Use it well
part7340.0
.

A Very Merry Christmas to you.


The
part7341.0
re was no signature. Harry stared at th
part7342.0
e note. Ron was admiring the
cloak.

"I
part7343.0
'd give anything for one of these," he 
part7344.0
said. "Anything. What's the
matter?"

"
part7345.0
Nothing," said Harry. He felt very stra
part7346.0
nge. Who had sent the cloak? Had
it rea
part7347.0
lly once belonged to his father?

Befor
part7348.0
e he could say or think anything else, 
part7349.0
the dormitory door was flung
open and F
part7350.0
red and George Weasley bounded in. Harr
part7351.0
y stuffed the cloak
quickly out of sigh
part7352.0
t. He didn't feel like sharing it with 
part7353.0
anyone else
yet.

"Merry Christmas!"

"
part7354.0
Hey, look -- Harry's got a Weasley swea
part7355.0
ter, too!"

Fred and George were wearin
part7356.0
g blue sweaters, one with a large yello
part7357.0
w F on
it, the other a G.

"Harry's is 
part7358.0
better than ours, though," said Fred, h
part7359.0
olding up Harry's
sweater. "She obvious
part7360.0
ly makes more of an effort if you're no
part7361.0
t family."

"Why aren't you wearing you
part7362.0
rs, Ron?" George demanded. "Come on, ge
part7363.0
t it
on, they're lovely and warm."

"I 
part7364.0
hate maroon," Ron moaned halfheartedly 
part7365.0
as he pulled it over his head.

"You ha
part7366.0
ven't got a letter on yours," George ob
part7367.0
served. "I suppose she
thinks you don't
part7368.0
 forget your name. But we're not stupid
part7369.0
 -- we know we're
called Gred and Forge
part7370.0
."

"What's all th is noise.

Percy Wea
part7371.0
sley stuck his head through the door, l
part7372.0
ooking disapproving. He
had clearly got
part7373.0
ten halfway through unwrapping his pres
part7374.0
ents as he, too,
carried a lumpy sweate
part7375.0
r over his arm, which

Fred seized.

"P
part7376.0
 for prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on
part7377.0
, we're all wearing ours, even
Harry go
part7378.0
t one."

"I -- don't -- want said Percy
part7379.0
 thickly, as the twins forced the sweat
part7380.0
er
over his head, knocking his glasses 
part7381.0
askew.

"And you're not sitting with th
part7382.0
e prefects today, either," said

George
part7383.0
. "Christmas is a time for family."

Th
part7384.0
ey frog-marched Percy from the room, hi
part7385.0
s arms pinned to his side by
his sweate
part7386.0
r.

Harry had never in all his life had
part7387.0
 such a Christmas dinner. A hundred
fat
part7388.0
, roast turkeys; mountains of roast and
part7389.0
 boiled potatoes; platters of
chipolata
part7390.0
s; tureens of buttered peas, silver boa
part7391.0
ts of thick, rich gravy
and cranberry s
part7392.0
auce -- and stacks of wizard crackers e
part7393.0
very few feet
along the table. These fa
part7394.0
ntastic party favors were nothing like 
part7395.0
the
feeble Muggle ones the Dursleys usu
part7396.0
ally bought, with their little
plastic 
part7397.0
toys and their flimsy paper hats inside
part7398.0
. Harry pulled a wizard
cracker with Fr
part7399.0
ed and it didn't just bang, it went off
part7400.0
 with a blast like
a cannon and engulfe
part7401.0
d them all in a cloud of blue smoke, wh
part7402.0
ile from the
inside exploded a rear adm
part7403.0
iral's hat and several live, white mice
part7404.0
. Up at
the High Table, Dumbledore had 
part7405.0
swapped his pointed wizard's hat for a

part7406.0
flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merr
part7407.0
ily at a joke Professor Flitwick
had ju
part7408.0
st read him.

Flaming Christmas pudding
part7409.0
s followed the turkey. Percy nearly bro
part7410.0
ke his
teeth on a silver sickle embedde
part7411.0
d in his slice. Harry watched Hagrid
ge
part7412.0
tting redder and redder in the face as 
part7413.0
he called for more wine,
finally kissin
part7414.0
g Professor McGonagall on the cheek, wh
part7415.0
o, to Harry's
amazement, giggled and bl
part7416.0
ushed, her top hat lopsided.

When Harr
part7417.0
y finally left the table, he was laden 
part7418.0
down with a stack of
things out of the 
part7419.0
crackers, including a pack of nonexplod
part7420.0
able, luminous
balloons, a Grow-Your-Ow
part7421.0
n-Warts kit, and his own new wizard che
part7422.0
ss set.
The white mice had disappeared 
part7423.0
and Harry had a nasty feeling they were
part7424.0

going to end up as Mrs. Norris's Chris
part7425.0
tmas dinner.

Harry and the Weasleys sp
part7426.0
ent a happy afternoon having a furious 
part7427.0
snowball
fight on the grounds. Then, co
part7428.0
ld, wet, and gasping for breath, they
r
part7429.0
eturned to the fire in the Gryffindor c
part7430.0
ommon room, where Harry broke in
his ne
part7431.0
w chess set by losing spectacularly to 
part7432.0
Ron. He suspected he
wouldn't have lost
part7433.0
 so badly if Percy hadn't tried to help
part7434.0
 him so much.

After a meal of turkey s
part7435.0
andwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christ
part7436.0
mas cake,
everyone felt too full and sl
part7437.0
eepy to do much before bed except sit a
part7438.0
nd
watch Percy chase Fred and George al
part7439.0
l over Gryffindor tower because
they'd 
part7440.0
stolen his prefect badge.

It had been 
part7441.0
Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet so
part7442.0
mething had been
nagging at the back of
part7443.0
 his mind all day. Not until he climbed
part7444.0
 into bed
was he free to think about it
part7445.0
: the invisibility cloak and whoever ha
part7446.0
d
sent it.

Ron, full of turkey and cak
part7447.0
e and with nothing mysterious to bother
part7448.0
 him,
fell asleep almost as soon as he'
part7449.0
d drawn the curtains of his
four-poster
part7450.0
. Harry leaned over the side of his own
part7451.0
 bed and pulled the
cloak out from unde
part7452.0
r it.

His father's... this had been hi
part7453.0
s father's. He let the material flow
ov
part7454.0
er his hands, smoother than silk, light
part7455.0
 as air. Use it well, the note
had said
part7456.0
.

He had to try it, now. He slipped ou
part7457.0
t of bed and wrapped the cloak
around h
part7458.0
imself. Looking down at his legs, he sa
part7459.0
w only moonlight and
shadows. It was a 
part7460.0
very funny feeling.

Use it well.

Sudd
part7461.0
enly, Harry felt wide-awake. The whole 
part7462.0
of Hogwarts was open to him
in this clo
part7463.0
ak. Excitement flooded through him as h
part7464.0
e stood there in the
dark and silence. 
part7465.0
He could go anywhere in this, anywhere,
part7466.0
 and Filch
would never know.

Ron grunt
part7467.0
ed in his sleep. Should Harry wake him?
part7468.0
 Something held him back
-- his father'
part7469.0
s cloak -- he felt that this time -- th
part7470.0
e first time -- he
wanted to use it alo
part7471.0
ne.

He crept out of the dormitory, dow
part7472.0
n the stairs, across the common room,
a
part7473.0
nd climbed through the portrait hole.


part7474.0
"Who's there?" squawked the Fat Lady. H
part7475.0
arry said nothing. He walked
quickly do
part7476.0
wn the corridor.

Where should he go? H
part7477.0
e stopped, his heart racing, and though
part7478.0
t. And then
it came to him. The Restric
part7479.0
ted Section in the library. He'd be abl
part7480.0
e to
read as long as he liked, as long 
part7481.0
as it took to find out who Flamel was.

part7482.0
He set off, drawing the invisibility cl
part7483.0
oak tight around him as he
walked.

The
part7484.0
 library was pitch-black and very eerie
part7485.0
. Harry lit a lamp to see his
way along
part7486.0
 the rows of books. The lamp looked as 
part7487.0
if it was floating along
in midair, and
part7488.0
 even though Harry could feel his arm s
part7489.0
upporting it, the
sight gave him the cr
part7490.0
eeps.

The Restricted Section was right
part7491.0
 at the back of the library. Step ping

part7492.0
carefully over the rope that separated 
part7493.0
these books from the rest of the
librar
part7494.0
y, he held up his lamp to read the titl
part7495.0
es.

They didn't tell him much. Their p
part7496.0
eeling, faded gold letters spelled
word
part7497.0
s in languages Harry couldn't understan
part7498.0
d. Some had no title at all.
One book h
part7499.0
ad a dark stain on it that looked horri
part7500.0
bly like blood. The
hairs on the back o
part7501.0
f Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was i
part7502.0
magining it,
maybe not, but he thought 
part7503.0
a faint whispering was coming from the 
part7504.0
books,
as though they knew someone was 
part7505.0
there who shouldn't be.

He had to star
part7506.0
t somewhere. Setting the lamp down care
part7507.0
fully on the floor,
he looked along the
part7508.0
 bottom shelf for an interestinglooking
part7509.0
 book. A large
black and silver volume 
part7510.0
caught his eye. He pulled it out with
d
part7511.0
ifficulty, because it was very heavy, a
part7512.0
nd, balancing it on his knee,
let it fa
part7513.0
ll open.

A piercing, bloodcurdling shr
part7514.0
iek split the silence -- the book was
s
part7515.0
creaming! Harry snapped it shut, but th
part7516.0
e shriek went on and on, one
high, unbr
part7517.0
oken, earsplitting note. He stumbled ba
part7518.0
ckward and knocked over
his lamp, which
part7519.0
 went out at once. Panicking, he heard 
part7520.0
footsteps coming
down the corridor outs
part7521.0
ide -- stuffing the shrieking book back
part7522.0
 on the
shelf, he ran for it. He passed
part7523.0
 Filch in the doorway; Filch's pale, wi
part7524.0
ld
eyes looked straight through him, an
part7525.0
d Harry slipped under Filch's
outstretc
part7526.0
hed arm and streaked off up the corrido
part7527.0
r, the book's shrieks
still ringing in 
part7528.0
his ears.

He came to a sudden halt in 
part7529.0
front of a tall suit of armor. He had b
part7530.0
een
so busy getting away from the libra
part7531.0
ry, he hadn't paid attention to where
h
part7532.0
e was going. Perhaps because it was dar
part7533.0
k, he didn't recognize where he
was at 
part7534.0
all. There was a suit of armor near the
part7535.0
 kitchens, he knew, but he
must be five
part7536.0
 floors above there.

"You asked me to 
part7537.0
come directly to you, Professor, if any
part7538.0
one was
wandering around at night, and 
part7539.0
somebody's been in the library Restrict
part7540.0
ed
Section."

Harry felt the blood drai
part7541.0
n out of his face. Wherever he was, Fil
part7542.0
ch must
know a shortcut, because his so
part7543.0
ft, greasy voice was getting nearer, an
part7544.0
d
to his horror, it was Snape who repli
part7545.0
ed, "The Restricted Section? Well,
they
part7546.0
 can't be far, we'll catch them."

Harr
part7547.0
y stood rooted to the spot as Filch and
part7548.0
 Snape came around the corner
ahead. Th
part7549.0
ey couldn't see him, of course, but it 
part7550.0
was a narrow corridor
and if they came 
part7551.0
much nearer they'd knock right into him
part7552.0
 -- the cloak
didn't stop him from bein
part7553.0
g solid.

He backed away as quietly as 
part7554.0
he could. A door stood ajar to his left
part7555.0
. It
was his only hope. He squeezed thr
part7556.0
ough it, holding his breath, trying
not
part7557.0
 to move it, and to his relief he manag
part7558.0
ed to get inside the room
without their
part7559.0
 noticing anything. They walked straigh
part7560.0
t past, and Harry
leaned against the wa
part7561.0
ll, breathing deeply, listening to thei
part7562.0
r footsteps
dying away. That had been c
part7563.0
lose, very close. It was a few seconds 
part7564.0
before
he noticed anything about the ro
part7565.0
om he had hidden in.

It looked like an
part7566.0
 unused classroom. The dark shapes of d
part7567.0
esks and chairs
were piled against the 
part7568.0
walls, and there was an upturned wastep
part7569.0
aper
basket -- but propped against the 
part7570.0
wall facing him was something that
didn
part7571.0
't look as if it belonged there, someth
part7572.0
ing that looked as if someone
had just 
part7573.0
put it there to keep it out of the way.
part7574.0


It was a magnificent mirror, as high 
part7575.0
as the ceiling, with an ornate gold
fra
part7576.0
me, standing on two clawed feet. There 
part7577.0
was an inscription carved
around the to
part7578.0
p: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt o
part7579.0
n wohsi. His panic
fading now that ther
part7580.0
e was no sound of Filch and Snape, Harr
part7581.0
y moved
nearer to the mirror, wanting t
part7582.0
o look at himself but see no reflection
part7583.0

again. He stepped in front of it.

He 
part7584.0
had to clap his hands to his mouth to s
part7585.0
top himself from screaming. He
whirled 
part7586.0
around. His heart was pounding far more
part7587.0
 furiously than when the
book had screa
part7588.0
med -- for he had seen not only himself
part7589.0
 in the mirror, but
a whole crowd of pe
part7590.0
ople standing right behind him.

But th
part7591.0
e room was empty. Breathing very fast, 
part7592.0
he turned slowly back to
the mirror.

T
part7593.0
here he was, reflected in it, white and
part7594.0
 scared-looking, and there,
reflected b
part7595.0
ehind him, were at least ten others. Ha
part7596.0
rry looked over his
shoulder -- but sti
part7597.0
ll, no one was there. Or were they all 
part7598.0
invisible,
too? Was he in fact in a roo
part7599.0
m full of invisible people and this mir
part7600.0
ror's
trick was that it reflected them,
part7601.0
 invisible or not?

He looked in the mi
part7602.0
rror again. A woman standing right behi
part7603.0
nd his
reflection was smiling at him an
part7604.0
d waving. He reached out a hand and fel
part7605.0
t
the air behind him. If she was really
part7606.0
 there, he'd touch her, their
reflectio
part7607.0
ns were so close together, but he felt 
part7608.0
only air -- she and the
others existed 
part7609.0
only in the mirror.

She was a very pre
part7610.0
tty woman. She had dark red hair and he
part7611.0
r eyes -- her
eyes are just like mine, 
part7612.0
Harry thought, edging a little closer t
part7613.0
o the
glass. Bright green -- exactly th
part7614.0
e same shape, but then he noticed that

part7615.0
she was crying; smiling, but crying at 
part7616.0
the same time. The tall, thin,
black-ha
part7617.0
ired man standing next to her put his a
part7618.0
rm around her. He wore
glasses, and his
part7619.0
 hair was very untidy. It stuck up at t
part7620.0
he back, just as
Harry's did.

Harry wa
part7621.0
s so close to the mirror now that his n
part7622.0
ose was nearly touching
that of his ref
part7623.0
lection.

"Mom?" he whispered. "Dad?"


part7624.0
They just looked at him, smiling. And s
part7625.0
lowly, Harry looked into the
faces of t
part7626.0
he other people in the mirror, and saw 
part7627.0
other pairs of green
eyes like his, oth
part7628.0
er noses like his, even a little old ma
part7629.0
n who looked as
though he had Harry's k
part7630.0
nobbly knees -- Harry was looking at hi
part7631.0
s family,
for the first time in his lif
part7632.0
e.

The Potters smiled and waved at Har
part7633.0
ry and he stared hungrily back at
them,
part7634.0
 his hands pressed flat against the gla
part7635.0
ss as though he was hoping
to fall righ
part7636.0
t through it and reach them. He had a p
part7637.0
owerful kind of ache
inside him, half j
part7638.0
oy, half terrible sadness.

How long he
part7639.0
 stood there, he didn't know. The refle
part7640.0
ctions did not fade
and he looked and l
part7641.0
ooked until a distant noise brought him
part7642.0
 back to his
senses. He couldn't stay h
part7643.0
ere, he had to find his way back to bed
part7644.0
. He
tore his eyes away from his mother
part7645.0
's face, whispered, "I'll come back,"
a
part7646.0
nd hurried from the room.

"You could h
part7647.0
ave woken me up," said Ron, crossly.

"
part7648.0
You can come tonight, I'm going back, I
part7649.0
 want to show you the mirror.

"I'd lik
part7650.0
e to see your mom and dad," Ron said ea
part7651.0
gerly.

"And I want to see all your fam
part7652.0
ily, all the Weasleys, you'll be able t
part7653.0
o
show me your other brothers and every
part7654.0
one."

"You can see them any old time,"
part7655.0
 said Ron. "Just come round my house
th
part7656.0
is summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows 
part7657.0
dead people. Shame about not
finding Fl
part7658.0
amel, though. Have some bacon or someth
part7659.0
ing, why aren't you
eating anything?"


part7660.0
Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his par
part7661.0
ents and would be seeing them
again ton
part7662.0
ight. He had almost forgotten about Fla
part7663.0
mel. It didn't seem very
important anym
part7664.0
ore. Who cared what the three headed do
part7665.0
g was guarding?
What did it matter if S
part7666.0
nape stole it, really?

"Are you all ri
part7667.0
ght?" said Ron. "You look odd."

What H
part7668.0
arry feared most was that he might not 
part7669.0
be able to find the mirror
room again. 
part7670.0
With Ron covered in the cloak, too, the
part7671.0
y had to walk much
more slowly the next
part7672.0
 night. They tried retracing Harry's ro
part7673.0
ute from the
library, wandering around 
part7674.0
the dark passageways for nearly an hour
part7675.0
.

"I'm freezing," said Ron. "Let's for
part7676.0
get it and go back."

"No!" Harry hisse
part7677.0
d. I know it's here somewhere."

They p
part7678.0
assed the ghost of a tall witch gliding
part7679.0
 in the opposite direction,
but saw no 
part7680.0
one else. just as Ron started moaning t
part7681.0
hat his feet were dead
with cold, Harry
part7682.0
 spotted the suit of armor.

"It's here
part7683.0
 -- just here -- yes!"

They pushed the
part7684.0
 door open. Harry dropped the cloak fro
part7685.0
m around his
shoulders and ran to the m
part7686.0
irror.

There they were. His mother and
part7687.0
 father beamed at the sight of him.

"S
part7688.0
ee?" Harry whispered.

"I can't see any
part7689.0
thing."

"Look! Look at them all... the
part7690.0
re are loads of them...."

"I can only 
part7691.0
see you."

"Look in it properly, go on,
part7692.0
 stand where I am."

Harry stepped asid
part7693.0
e, but with Ron in front of the mirror,
part7694.0
 he couldn't
see his family anymore, ju
part7695.0
st Ron in his paisley pajamas.

Ron, th
part7696.0
ough, was staring transfixed at his ima
part7697.0
ge.

"Look at me!" he said.

"Can you s
part7698.0
ee all your family standing around you?
part7699.0
"

"No -- I'm alone -- but I'm differen
part7700.0
t -- I look older -- and I'm head
boy!"
part7701.0


"What?"

"I am -- I'm wearing the bad
part7702.0
ge like Bill used to -- and I'm holding
part7703.0
 the
house cup and the Quidditch cup --
part7704.0
 I'm Quidditch captain, too.

Ron tore 
part7705.0
his eyes away from this splendid sight 
part7706.0
to look excitedly at
Harry.

"Do you th
part7707.0
ink this mirror shows the future?"

"Ho
part7708.0
w can it? All my family are dead -- let
part7709.0
 me have another look --"

"You had it 
part7710.0
to yourself all last night, give me a b
part7711.0
it more time."

"You're only holding th
part7712.0
e Quidditch cup, what's interesting abo
part7713.0
ut that? I
want to see my parents."

"D
part7714.0
on't push me --"

A sudden noise outsid
part7715.0
e in the corridor put an end to their d
part7716.0
iscussion.
They hadn't realized how lou
part7717.0
dly they had been talking.

"Quick!"

R
part7718.0
on threw the cloak back over them as th
part7719.0
e luminous eyes of Mrs. Norris
came rou
part7720.0
nd the door. Ron and Harry stood quite 
part7721.0
still, both thinking the
same thing -- 
part7722.0
did the cloak work on cats? After what 
part7723.0
seemed an age, she
turned and left.

"T
part7724.0
his isn't safe -- she might have gone f
part7725.0
or Filch, I bet she heard us.
Come on."
part7726.0


And Ron pulled Harry out of the room.
part7727.0


The snow still hadn't melted the next
part7728.0
 morning.

"Want to play chess, Harry?"
part7729.0
 said Ron.

"No."

"Why don't we go dow
part7730.0
n and visit Hagrid?"

"No... you go..."
part7731.0


"I know what you're thinking about, H
part7732.0
arry, that mirror. Don't go back
tonigh
part7733.0
t."

"Why not?"

"I dunno, I've just go
part7734.0
t a bad feeling about it -- and anyway,
part7735.0
 you've had
too many close shaves alrea
part7736.0
dy. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are
w
part7737.0
andering around. So what if they can't 
part7738.0
see you? What if they walk into
you? Wh
part7739.0
at if you knock something over?"

"You 
part7740.0
sound like Hermione."

"I'm serious, Ha
part7741.0
rry, don't go."

But Harry only had one
part7742.0
 thought in his head, which was to get 
part7743.0
back in
front of the mirror, and Ron wa
part7744.0
sn't going to stop him.

That third nig
part7745.0
ht he found his way more quickly than b
part7746.0
efore. He was
walking so fast he knew h
part7747.0
e was making more noise than was wise, 
part7748.0
but he
didn't meet anyone.

And there w
part7749.0
ere his mother and father smiling at hi
part7750.0
m again, and one of
his grandfathers no
part7751.0
dding happily. Harry sank down to sit o
part7752.0
n the floor in
front of the mirror. The
part7753.0
re was nothing to stop him from staying
part7754.0
 here all
night with his family. Nothin
part7755.0
g at all.

Except --

"So -- back again
part7756.0
, Harry?"

Harry felt as though his ins
part7757.0
ides had turned to ice. He looked behin
part7758.0
d
him. Sitting on one of the desks by t
part7759.0
he wall was none other than Albus
Dumbl
part7760.0
edore. Harry must have walked straight 
part7761.0
past him, so desperate to
get to the mi
part7762.0
rror he hadn't noticed him.

" -- I did
part7763.0
n't see you, sir."

"Strange how nearsi
part7764.0
ghted being invisible can make you," sa
part7765.0
id Dumbledore,
and Harry was relieved t
part7766.0
o see that he was smiling.

"So," said 
part7767.0
Dumbledore, slipping off the desk to si
part7768.0
t on the floor with
Harry, "you, like h
part7769.0
undreds before you, have discovered the
part7770.0
 delights of
the Mirror of Erised."

"I
part7771.0
 didn't know it was called that, Sir."

part7772.0

"But I expect you've realized by now w
part7773.0
hat it does?"

"It -- well -- it shows 
part7774.0
me my family --"

"And it showed your f
part7775.0
riend Ron himself as head boy."

"How d
part7776.0
id you know --?"

"I don't need a cloak
part7777.0
 to become invisible," said Dumbledore 
part7778.0
gently.
"Now, can you think what the Mi
part7779.0
rror of Erised shows us all?"

Harry sh
part7780.0
ook his head.

"Let me explain. The hap
part7781.0
piest man on earth would be able to use
part7782.0
 the
Mirror of Erised like a normal mir
part7783.0
ror, that is, he would look into it
and
part7784.0
 see himself exactly as he is. Does tha
part7785.0
t help?"

Harry thought. Then he said s
part7786.0
lowly, "It shows us what we want...
wha
part7787.0
tever we want..."

"Yes and no," said D
part7788.0
umbledore quietly. "It shows us nothing
part7789.0
 more or less
than the deepest, most de
part7790.0
sperate desire of our hearts. You, who 
part7791.0
have
never known your family, see them 
part7792.0
standing around you. Ronald Weasley,
wh
part7793.0
o has always been overshadowed by his b
part7794.0
rothers, sees himself standing
alone, t
part7795.0
he best of all of them. However, this m
part7796.0
irror will give us
neither knowledge or
part7797.0
 truth. Men have wasted away before it,
part7798.0
 entranced by
what they have seen, or b
part7799.0
een driven mad, not knowing if what it 
part7800.0
shows is
real or even possible.

"The M
part7801.0
irror will be moved to a new home tomor
part7802.0
row, Harry, and I ask you
not to go loo
part7803.0
king for it again. If you ever do run a
part7804.0
cross it, you will
now be prepared. It 
part7805.0
does not do to dwell on dreams and forg
part7806.0
et to live,
remember that. Now, why don
part7807.0
't you put that admirable cloak back on
part7808.0
 and
get off to bed?"

Harry stood up.

part7809.0

"Sir -- Professor Dumbledore? Can I as
part7810.0
k you something?"

"Obviously, you've j
part7811.0
ust done so," Dumbledore smiled. "You m
part7812.0
ay ask me one
more thing, however."

"W
part7813.0
hat do you see when you look in the mir
part7814.0
ror?"

"I? I see myself holding a pair 
part7815.0
of thick, woolen socks."

Harry stared.
part7816.0


"One can never have enough socks," sa
part7817.0
id Dumbledore. "Another Christmas
has c
part7818.0
ome and gone and I didn't get a single 
part7819.0
pair. People will insist on
giving me b
part7820.0
ooks."

It was only when he was back in
part7821.0
 bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledo
part7822.0
re
might not have been quite truthful. 
part7823.0
But then, he thought, as he shoved
Scab
part7824.0
bers off his pillow, it had been quite 
part7825.0
a personal question.


CHAPTER THIRTEEN
part7826.0


NICOLAS FLAMEL

Dumbledore had convin
part7827.0
ced Harry not to go looking for the Mir
part7828.0
ror of
Erised again, and for the rest o
part7829.0
f the Christmas holidays the
invisibili
part7830.0
ty cloak stayed folded at the bottom of
part7831.0
 his trunk. Harry
wished he could forge
part7832.0
t what he'd seen in the mirror as easil
part7833.0
y, but he
couldn't. He started having n
part7834.0
ightmares. Over and over again he dream
part7835.0
ed
about his parents disappearing in a 
part7836.0
flash of green light, while a high
voic
part7837.0
e cackled with laughter.

"You see, Dum
part7838.0
bledore was right, that mirror could dr
part7839.0
ive you mad," said
Ron, when Harry told
part7840.0
 him about these drearns.

Hermione, wh
part7841.0
o came back the day before term started
part7842.0
, took a different
view of things. She 
part7843.0
was torn between horror at the idea of 
part7844.0
Harry being
out of bed, roaming the sch
part7845.0
ool three nights in a row ("If Filch ha
part7846.0
d
caught you!"), and disappointment tha
part7847.0
t he hadn't at least found out who
Nico
part7848.0
las Flamel was.

They had almost given 
part7849.0
up hope of ever finding Flamel in a li-
part7850.0
 brary
book, even though Harry was stil
part7851.0
l sure he'd read the name somewhere.
On
part7852.0
ce term had started, they were back to 
part7853.0
skimming through books for ten
minutes 
part7854.0
during their breaks. Harry had even les
part7855.0
s time than the other
two, because Quid
part7856.0
ditch practice had started again.

Wood
part7857.0
 was working the team harder than ever.
part7858.0
 Even the endless rain that
had replace
part7859.0
d the snow couldn't dampen his spirits.
part7860.0
 The Weasleys
complained that Wood was 
part7861.0
becoming a fanatic, but Harry was on Wo
part7862.0
od's
side. If they won their next match
part7863.0
, against Hufflepuff, they would
overta
part7864.0
ke Slytherin in the house championship 
part7865.0
for the first time in seven
years. Quit
part7866.0
e apart from wanting to win, Harry foun
part7867.0
d that he had fewer
nightmares when he 
part7868.0
was tired out after training.

Then, du
part7869.0
ring one particularly wet and muddy pra
part7870.0
ctice session, Wood gave
the team a bit
part7871.0
 of bad news. He'd just gotten very ang
part7872.0
ry with the
Weasleys, who kept dive-bom
part7873.0
bing each other and pretending to fall 
part7874.0
off
their brooms.

"Will you stop messi
part7875.0
ng around!" he yelled. "That's exactly 
part7876.0
the sort of
thing that'll lose us the m
part7877.0
atch! Snape's refereeing this time, and
part7878.0
 he'll
be looking for any excuse to kno
part7879.0
ck points off Gryffindor!"

George Weas
part7880.0
ley really did fall off his broom at th
part7881.0
ese words.

"Snape's refereeing?" he sp
part7882.0
luttered through a mouthful of mud. "Wh
part7883.0
en's
he ever refereed a Quidditch match
part7884.0
? He's not going to be fair if we
might
part7885.0
 overtake Slytherin."

The rest of the 
part7886.0
team landed next to George to complain,
part7887.0
 too.

"It's not my fault," said Wood. 
part7888.0
"We've just got to make sure we play a

part7889.0
clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excu
part7890.0
se to pick on us."

Which was all very 
part7891.0
well, thought Harry, but he had another
part7892.0
 reason for
not wanting Snape near him 
part7893.0
while he was playing Quidditch....

The
part7894.0
 rest of the team hung back to talk to 
part7895.0
one another as usual at the
end of prac
part7896.0
tice, but Harry headed straight back to
part7897.0
 the Gryffindor common
room, where he f
part7898.0
ound Ron and Hermione playing chess. Ch
part7899.0
ess was the only
thing Hermione ever lo
part7900.0
st at, something Harry and Ron thought 
part7901.0
was very
good for her.

"Don't talk to 
part7902.0
me for a moment," said Ron when Harry s
part7903.0
at down next to
him, "I need to concen 
part7904.0
--" He caught sight of Harry's face. "W
part7905.0
hat's the
matter with you? You look ter
part7906.0
rible."

Speaking quietly so that no on
part7907.0
e else would hear, Harry told the other
part7908.0

two about Snape's sudden, sinister des
part7909.0
ire to be a Quidditch referee.

"Don't 
part7910.0
play," said Hermione at once.

"Say you
part7911.0
're ill," said Ron.

"Pretend to break 
part7912.0
your leg," Hermione suggested.

"Really
part7913.0
 break your leg," said Ron.

"I can't,"
part7914.0
 said Harry. "There isn't a reserve See
part7915.0
ker. If I back out,
Gryffindor can't pl
part7916.0
ay at all."

At that moment Neville top
part7917.0
pled into the common room. How he had m
part7918.0
anaged
to climb through the portrait ho
part7919.0
le was anyone's guess, because his legs
part7920.0

had been stuck together with what they
part7921.0
 recognized at once as the
Leg-Locker C
part7922.0
urse. He must have had to bunny hop all
part7923.0
 the way up to
Gryffindor tower.

Every
part7924.0
one fell over laughing except Hermione,
part7925.0
 who leapt up and performed
the counter
part7926.0
curse. Neville's legs sprang apart and 
part7927.0
he got to his feet,
trembling. "What ha
part7928.0
ppened?" Hermione asked him, leading hi
part7929.0
m over to sit
with Harry and Ron.

"Mal
part7930.0
foy," said Neville shakily. "I met him 
part7931.0
outside the library. He said
he'd been 
part7932.0
looking for someone to practice that on
part7933.0
."

"Go to Professor McGonagall!" Hermi
part7934.0
one urged Neville. "Report him!"

Nevil
part7935.0
le shook his head.

"I don't want more 
part7936.0
trouble," he mumbled.

"You've got to s
part7937.0
tand up to him, Neville!" said Ron. "He
part7938.0
's used to
walking all over people, but
part7939.0
 that's no reason to lie down in front 
part7940.0
of
him and make it easier."

"There's n
part7941.0
o need to tell me I'm not brave enough 
part7942.0
to be in Gryffindor,
Malfoy's already d
part7943.0
one that," Neville choked out.

Harry f
part7944.0
elt in the pocket of his robes and pull
part7945.0
ed out a Chocolate Frog,
the very last 
part7946.0
one from the box Hermione had given him
part7947.0
 for Christmas. He
gave it to Neville, 
part7948.0
who looked as though he might cry.

"Yo
part7949.0
u're worth twelve of Malfoy," Harry sai
part7950.0
d. "The Sorting Hat chose you
for Gryff
part7951.0
indor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? I
part7952.0
n stinking Slytherin."

Neville's lips 
part7953.0
twitched in a weak smile as he unwrappe
part7954.0
d the frog.

"Thanks, Harry... I think 
part7955.0
I'll go to bed.... D'you want the card,
part7956.0
 you
collect them, don't you?"

As Nevi
part7957.0
lle walked away, Harry looked at the Fa
part7958.0
mous Wizard card.

"Dumbledore again," 
part7959.0
he said, "He was the first one I ever-"
part7960.0


He gasped. He stared at the back of t
part7961.0
he card. Then he looked up at Ron
and H
part7962.0
ermione.

"I've found him!" he whispere
part7963.0
d. "I've found Flamel! I told you I'd r
part7964.0
ead
the name somewhere before, I read i
part7965.0
t on the train coming here -- listen
to
part7966.0
 this: 'Dumbledore is particularly famo
part7967.0
us for his defeat of the dark
wizard Gr
part7968.0
indelwald in 1945, for the discovery of
part7969.0
 the twelve uses of
dragon's blood, and
part7970.0
 his work on alchemy with his partner, 
part7971.0
Nicolas
Flamel'!"

Hermione jumped to h
part7972.0
er feet. She hadn't looked so excited s
part7973.0
ince they'd
gotten back the marks for t
part7974.0
heir very first piece of homework.

"St
part7975.0
ay there!" she said, and she sprinted u
part7976.0
p the stairs to the girls'
dormitories.
part7977.0
 Harry and Ron barely had time to excha
part7978.0
nge mystified looks
before she was dash
part7979.0
ing back, an enormous old book in her a
part7980.0
rms.

"I never thought to look in here!
part7981.0
" she whispered excitedly. "I got this

part7982.0
out of the library weeks ago for a bit 
part7983.0
of light reading."

"Light?" said Ron, 
part7984.0
but Hermione told him to be quiet until
part7985.0
 she'd looked
something up, and started
part7986.0
 flicking frantically through the pages
part7987.0
,
muttering to herself.

At last she fo
part7988.0
und what she was looking for.

"I knew 
part7989.0
it! I knew it!"

"Are we allowed to spe
part7990.0
ak yet?" said Ron grumpily. Hermione ig
part7991.0
nored him.

"Nicolas Flamel," she whisp
part7992.0
ered dramatically, "is the only known m
part7993.0
aker
of the Sorcerer's Stone!"

This di
part7994.0
dn't have quite the effect she'd expect
part7995.0
ed.

"The what?" said Harry and Ron.

"
part7996.0
Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look 
part7997.0
-- read that, there."

She pushed the b
part7998.0
ook toward them, and Harry and Ron read
part7999.0
: The ancient
study of alchemy is conce
part8000.0
rned with making the Sorcerer's Stone, 
part8001.0
a
legendary substance with astonishing 
part8002.0
powers. The stone will transform
any me
part8003.0
tal into pure gold. It also produces th
part8004.0
e Elixir of Life, which
will make the d
part8005.0
rinker immortal.

There have been many 
part8006.0
reports of the Sorcerer's Stone over th
part8007.0
e centuries,
but the only Stone current
part8008.0
ly in existence belongs to Mr. Nicolas 
part8009.0
Flamel,
the noted alchemist and opera l
part8010.0
over. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his si
part8011.0
x
hundred and sixty-fifth birthday last
part8012.0
 year, enjoys a quiet life in Devon
wit
part8013.0
h his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and 
part8014.0
fifty-eight).

"See?" said Hermione, wh
part8015.0
en Harry and Ron had finished. "The dog
part8016.0
 must be
guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's S
part8017.0
tone! I bet he asked Dumbledore to keep
part8018.0
 it
safe for him, because they're frien
part8019.0
ds and he knew someone was after it,
th
part8020.0
at's why he wanted the Stone moved out 
part8021.0
of Gringotts!"

"A stone that makes gol
part8022.0
d and stops you from ever dying!" said 
part8023.0
Harry. "No
wonder Snape's after it! Any
part8024.0
one would want it."

"And no wonder we 
part8025.0
couldn't find Flamel in that Study of R
part8026.0
ecent
Developments in Wizardry," said R
part8027.0
on. "He's not exactly recent if he's
si
part8028.0
x hundred and sixty-five, is he?"

The 
part8029.0
next morning in Defense Against the Dar
part8030.0
k Arts, while copying down
different wa
part8031.0
ys of treating werewolf bites, Harry an
part8032.0
d Ron were still
discussing what they'd
part8033.0
 do with a Sorcerer's Stone if they had
part8034.0
 one. It
wasn't until Ron said he'd buy
part8035.0
 his own Quidditch team that Harry
reme
part8036.0
mbered about Snape and the coming match
part8037.0
.

"I'm going to play," he told Ron and
part8038.0
 Hermione. "If I don't, all the
Slyther
part8039.0
ins will think I'm just too scared to f
part8040.0
ace Snape. I'll show
them... it'll real
part8041.0
ly wipe the smiles off their faces if w
part8042.0
e win."

"Just as long as we're not wip
part8043.0
ing you off the field," said Hermione.

part8044.0

As the match drew nearer, however, Har
part8045.0
ry became more and more nervous,
whatev
part8046.0
er he told Ron and Hermione. The rest o
part8047.0
f the team wasn't too calm,
either. The
part8048.0
 idea of overtaking Slytherin in the ho
part8049.0
use championship was
wonderful, no one 
part8050.0
had done it for seven years, but would 
part8051.0
they be allowed
to, with such a biased 
part8052.0
referee?

Harry didn't know whether he 
part8053.0
was imagining it or not, but he seemed 
part8054.0
to
keep running into Snape wherever he 
part8055.0
went. At times, he even wondered
whethe
part8056.0
r Snape was following him, trying to ca
part8057.0
tch him on his own. Potions
lessons wer
part8058.0
e turning into a sort of weekly torture
part8059.0
, Snape was so
horrible to Harry. Could
part8060.0
 Snape possibly know they'd found out a
part8061.0
bout the
Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't
part8062.0
 see how he could -- yet he sometimes h
part8063.0
ad
the horrible feeling that Snape coul
part8064.0
d read minds.

Harry knew, when they wi
part8065.0
shed him good luck outside the locker r
part8066.0
ooms the
next afternoon, that Ron and H
part8067.0
ermione were wondering whether they'd e
part8068.0
ver
see him alive again. This wasn't wh
part8069.0
at you'd call comforting. Harry
hardly 
part8070.0
heard a word of Wood's pep talk as he p
part8071.0
ulled on his Quidditch
robes and picked
part8072.0
 up his Nimbus Two Thousand.

Ron and H
part8073.0
ermione, meanwhile, had found a place i
part8074.0
n the stands next to
Neville, who could
part8075.0
n't understand why they looked so grim 
part8076.0
and worried, or
why they had both broug
part8077.0
ht their wands to the match. Little did
part8078.0
 Harry
know that Ron and Hermione had b
part8079.0
een secretly practicing the Leg-Locker

part8080.0
Curse. They'd gotten the idea from Malf
part8081.0
oy using it on Neville, and were
ready 
part8082.0
to use it on Snape if he showed any sig
part8083.0
n of wanting to hurt Harry.

"Now, don'
part8084.0
t forget, it's Locomotor Mortis," Hermi
part8085.0
one muttered as Ron
slipped his wand up
part8086.0
 his sleeve.

"I know," Ron snapped. "D
part8087.0
on't nag."

Back in the locker room, Wo
part8088.0
od had taken Harry aside.

"Don't want 
part8089.0
to pressure you, Potter, but if we ever
part8090.0
 need an early
capture of the Snitch it
part8091.0
's now. Finish the game before Snape ca
part8092.0
n favor
Hufflepuff too much."

"The who
part8093.0
le school's out there!" said Fred Weasl
part8094.0
ey, peering out of the
door. "Even -- b
part8095.0
limey -- Dumbledore's come to watch!"


part8096.0
Harry's heart did a somersault.

"Dumbl
part8097.0
edore?" he said, dashing to the door to
part8098.0
 make sure. Fred was right.
There was n
part8099.0
o mistaking that silver beard.

Harry c
part8100.0
ould have laughed out loud with relief 
part8101.0
He was safe. There was
simply no way th
part8102.0
at Snape would dare to try to hurt him 
part8103.0
if Dumbledore was
watching.

Perhaps th
part8104.0
at was why Snape was looking so angry a
part8105.0
s the teams marched
onto the field, som
part8106.0
ething that Ron noticed, too.

"I've ne
part8107.0
ver seen Snape look so mean," he told H
part8108.0
ermione. "Look -they're
off Ouch!"

Som
part8109.0
eone had poked Ron in the back of the h
part8110.0
ead. It was Malfoy.

"Oh, sorry, Weasle
part8111.0
y, didn't see you there."

Malfoy grinn
part8112.0
ed broadly at Crabbe and Goyle.

"Wonde
part8113.0
r how long Potter's going to stay on hi
part8114.0
s broom this time? Anyone
want a bet? W
part8115.0
hat about you, Weasley?"

Ron didn't an
part8116.0
swer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff
part8117.0
 a penalty because
George Weasley had h
part8118.0
it a Bludger at him. Hermione, who had 
part8119.0
all her
fingers crossed in her lap, was
part8120.0
 squinting fixedly at Harry, who was
ci
part8121.0
rcling the game like a hawk, looking fo
part8122.0
r the Snitch.

"You know how I think th
part8123.0
ey choose people for the Gryffindor tea
part8124.0
m?" said
Malfoy loudly a few minutes la
part8125.0
ter, as Snape awarded Hufflepuff anothe
part8126.0
r
penalty for no reason at all. "It's p
part8127.0
eople they feel sorry for. See,
there's
part8128.0
 Potter, who's got no parents, then the
part8129.0
re's the Weasleys, who've
got no money 
part8130.0
-- you should be on the team, Longbotto
part8131.0
m, you've got no
brains."

Neville went
part8132.0
 bright red but turned in his seat to f
part8133.0
ace Malfoy.

"I'm worth twelve of you, 
part8134.0
Malfoy," he stammered.

Malfoy, Crabbe,
part8135.0
 and Goyle howled with laughter, but Ro
part8136.0
n, still not
daring to take his eyes fr
part8137.0
om the game, said, "You tell him, Nevil
part8138.0
le."

"Longbottom, if brains were gold 
part8139.0
you'd be poorer than Weasley, and
that'
part8140.0
s saying something."

Ron's nerves were
part8141.0
 already stretched to the breaking poin
part8142.0
t with anxiety
about Harry.

"I'm warni
part8143.0
ng you, Malfoy -- one more word

"Ron!"
part8144.0
 said Hermione suddenly, "Harry --"

"W
part8145.0
hat? Where?"

Harry had suddenly gone i
part8146.0
nto a spectacular dive, which drew gasp
part8147.0
s and
cheers from the crowd. Hermione s
part8148.0
tood up, her crossed fingers in her
mou
part8149.0
th, as Harry streaked toward the ground
part8150.0
 like a bullet.

"You're in luck, Weasl
part8151.0
ey, Potter's obviously spotted some mon
part8152.0
ey on the
ground!" said Malfoy.

Ron sn
part8153.0
apped. Before Malfoy knew what was happ
part8154.0
ening, Ron was on top of
him, wrestling
part8155.0
 him to the ground. Neville hesitated, 
part8156.0
then clambered over
the back of his sea
part8157.0
t to help.

"Come on, Harry!" Hermione 
part8158.0
screamed, leaping onto her seat to watc
part8159.0
h as
Harry sped straight at Snape -- sh
part8160.0
e didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron
rol
part8161.0
ling around under her seat, or the scuf
part8162.0
fles and yelps coming from the
whirl of
part8163.0
 fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Go
part8164.0
yle.

Up in the air, Snape turned on hi
part8165.0
s broomstick just in time to see
someth
part8166.0
ing scarlet shoot past him, missing him
part8167.0
 by inches -- the next
second, Harry ha
part8168.0
d pulled out of the dive, his arm raise
part8169.0
d in triumph, the
Snitch clasped in his
part8170.0
 hand.

The stands erupted; it had to b
part8171.0
e a record, no one could ever remember

part8172.0
the Snitch being caught so quickly.

"R
part8173.0
on! Ron! Where are you? The game's over
part8174.0
! Harry's won! We've won!
Gryffindor is
part8175.0
 in the lead!" shrieked Hermione, danci
part8176.0
ng up and down on
her seat and hugging 
part8177.0
Parvati Patil in the row in front.

Har
part8178.0
ry jumped off his broom, a foot from th
part8179.0
e ground. He couldn't believe
it. He'd 
part8180.0
done it -- the game was over; it had ba
part8181.0
rely lasted five
minutes. As Gryffindor
part8182.0
s came spilling onto the field, he saw 
part8183.0
Snape land
nearby, white-faced and tigh
part8184.0
t-lipped -- then Harry felt a hand on h
part8185.0
is
shoulder and looked up into Dumbledo
part8186.0
re's smiling face.

"Well done," said D
part8187.0
umbledore quietly, so that only Harry c
part8188.0
ould hear.
"Nice to see you haven't bee
part8189.0
n brooding about that mirror... been ke
part8190.0
eping
busy... excellent..."

Snape spat
part8191.0
 bitterly on the ground.

Harry left th
part8192.0
e locker room alone some time later, to
part8193.0
 take his Nimbus Two
Thousand back to t
part8194.0
he broomshed. He couldn't ever remember
part8195.0
 feeling
happier. He'd really done some
part8196.0
thing to be proud of now -- no one coul
part8197.0
d
say he was just a famous name any mor
part8198.0
e. The evening air had never
smelled so
part8199.0
 sweet. He walked over the damp grass, 
part8200.0
reliving the last hour
in his head, whi
part8201.0
ch was a happy blur: Gryffindors runnin
part8202.0
g to lift him
onto their shoulders; Ron
part8203.0
 and Hermione in the distance, jumping 
part8204.0
up and
down, Ron cheering through a hea
part8205.0
vy nosebleed.

Harry had reached the sh
part8206.0
ed. He leaned against the wooden door a
part8207.0
nd looked
up at Hogwarts, with its wind
part8208.0
ows glowing red in the setting sun.
Gry
part8209.0
ffindor in the lead. He'd done it, he'd
part8210.0
 shown Snape....

And speaking of Snape
part8211.0
...

A hooded figure came swiftly down 
part8212.0
the front steps of the castle. Clearly

part8213.0
not wanting to be seen, it walked as fa
part8214.0
st as possible toward the
forbidden for
part8215.0
est. Harry's victory faded from his min
part8216.0
d as he watched. He
recognized the figu
part8217.0
re's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking int
part8218.0
o the forest
while everyone else was at
part8219.0
 dinner -- what was going on?

Harry ju
part8220.0
mped back on his Nimbus Two Thousand an
part8221.0
d took off. Gliding
silently over the c
part8222.0
astle he saw Snape enter the forest at 
part8223.0
a run. He
followed.

The trees were so 
part8224.0
thick he couldn't see where Snape had g
part8225.0
one. He flew in
circles, lower and lowe
part8226.0
r, brushing the top branches of trees u
part8227.0
ntil he
heard voices. He glided toward 
part8228.0
them and landed noiselessly in a toweri
part8229.0
ng
beech tree.

He climbed carefully al
part8230.0
ong one of the branches, holding tight 
part8231.0
to his
broomstick, trying to see throug
part8232.0
h the leaves. Below, in a shadowy
clear
part8233.0
ing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. 
part8234.0
Quirrell was there, too.
Harry couldn't
part8235.0
 make out the look on his face, but he 
part8236.0
was stuttering
worse than ever. Harry s
part8237.0
trained to catch what they were saying.
part8238.0


"... d-don't know why you wanted t-t-
part8239.0
to meet here of all p-places,
Severus..
part8240.0
."

"Oh, I thought we'd keep this priva
part8241.0
te," said Snape, his voice icy.
"Studen
part8242.0
ts aren't supposed to know about the So
part8243.0
rcerer's Stone, after
all."

Harry lean
part8244.0
ed forward. Quirrell was mumbling somet
part8245.0
hing. Snape interrupted
him.

"Have you
part8246.0
 found out how to get past that beast o
part8247.0
f Hagrid's yet?"

"B-b-but Severus, I -
part8248.0
-"

"You don't want me as your enemy, Q
part8249.0
uirrell," said Snape, taking a step
tow
part8250.0
ard him.

"I-I don't know what you

"Yo
part8251.0
u know perfectly well what I mean."

An
part8252.0
 owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fe
part8253.0
ll out of the tree. He steadied
himself
part8254.0
 in time to hear Snape say, "-- your li
part8255.0
ttle bit of hocus-pocus.
I'm waiting."

part8256.0

"B-but I d-d-don't --"

"Very well," S
part8257.0
nape cut in. "We'll have another little
part8258.0
 chat soon, when
you've had time to thi
part8259.0
nk things over and decided where your l
part8260.0
oyalties
lie."

He threw his cloak over
part8261.0
 his head and strode out of the clearin
part8262.0
g. It was
almost dark now, but Harry co
part8263.0
uld see Quirrell, standing quite still 
part8264.0
as
though he was petrified.

"Harry, wh
part8265.0
ere have you been?" Hermione squeaked.

part8266.0

"We won! You won! We won!" shouted Ron
part8267.0
, thumping Harry on the back. "And
I ga
part8268.0
ve Malfoy a black eye, and Neville trie
part8269.0
d to take on Crabbe and Goyle
single-ha
part8270.0
nded! He's still out cold but Madam Pom
part8271.0
ftey says he'll be all
right - talk abo
part8272.0
ut showing Slytherin! Everyone's waitin
part8273.0
g for you in the
common room, we're hav
part8274.0
ing a party, Fred and George stole some
part8275.0
 cakes and
stuff from the kitchens."

"
part8276.0
Never mind that now," said Harry breath
part8277.0
lessly. "Let's find an empty
room, you 
part8278.0
wait 'til you hear this...."

He made s
part8279.0
ure Peeves wasn't inside before shuttin
part8280.0
g the door behind them,
then he told th
part8281.0
em what he'd seen and heard.

"So we we
part8282.0
re right, it is the Sorcerer's Stone, a
part8283.0
nd Snape's trying to
force Quirrell to 
part8284.0
help him get it. He asked if he knew ho
part8285.0
w to get past
Fluffy - and he said some
part8286.0
thing about Quirrell's 'hocus pocuss-- 
part8287.0
I reckon
there are other things guardin
part8288.0
g the stone apart from Fluffy, loads of
part8289.0

enchantments, probably, and Quirrell w
part8290.0
ould have done some anti-Dark Arts
spel
part8291.0
l that Snape needs to break through --"
part8292.0


"So you mean the Stone's only safe as
part8293.0
 long as Quirrell stands up to
Snape?" 
part8294.0
said Hermione in alarm.

"It'll be gone
part8295.0
 by next Tuesday," said Ron.

Quirrell, however, must have been b
part8298.0
raver than they'd thought. In the
weeks
part8299.0
 that followed he did seem to be gettin
part8300.0
g paler and thinner, but it
didn't look
part8301.0
 as though he'd cracked yet.

Every tim
part8302.0
e they passed the third-floor corridor,
part8303.0
 Harry, Ron, and
Hermione would press t
part8304.0
heir ears to the door to check that Flu
part8305.0
ffy was
still growling inside. Snape wa
part8306.0
s sweeping about in his usual bad tempe
part8307.0
r,
which surely meant that the Stone wa
part8308.0
s still safe. Whenever Harry passed
Qui
part8309.0
rrell these days he gave him an encoura
part8310.0
ging sort of smile, and Ron
had started
part8311.0
 telling people off for laughing at Qui
part8312.0
rrell's stutter.

Hermione, however, ha
part8313.0
d more on her mind than the Sorcerer's 
part8314.0
Stone. She
had started drawing up study
part8315.0
 schedules and colorcoding all her note
part8316.0
s.
Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, 
part8317.0
but she kept nagging them to do the
sam
part8318.0
e.

"Hermione, the exams are ages away.
part8319.0
"

"Ten weeks," Hermione snapped. "That
part8320.0
's not ages, that's like a second to
Ni
part8321.0
colas Flamel."

"But we're not six hund
part8322.0
red years old," Ron reminded her. "Anyw
part8323.0
ay, what
are you studying for, you alre
part8324.0
ady know it A."

"What am I studying fo
part8325.0
r? Are you crazy? You realize we need t
part8326.0
o pass
these exams to get into the seco
part8327.0
nd year? They're very important, I
shou
part8328.0
ld have started studying a month ago, I
part8329.0
 don't know what's gotten
into me...."

part8330.0

Unfortunately, the teachers seemed to 
part8331.0
be thinking along the same lines
as Her
part8332.0
mione. They piled so much homework on t
part8333.0
hem that the Easter
holidays weren't ne
part8334.0
arly as much fun as the Christmas ones.
part8335.0
 It was hard
to relax with Hermione nex
part8336.0
t to you reciting the twelve uses of dr
part8337.0
agon's
blood or practicing wand movemen
part8338.0
ts. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron

part8339.0
spent most of their free time in the li
part8340.0
brary with her, trying to get
through a
part8341.0
ll their extra work.

"I'll never remem
part8342.0
ber this," Ron burst out one afternoon,
part8343.0
 throwing down
his quill and looking lo
part8344.0
ngingly out of the library window. It w
part8345.0
as the
first really fine day they'd had
part8346.0
 in months. The sky was a clear,
forget
part8347.0
-me-not blue, and there was a feeling i
part8348.0
n the air of summer coming.

Harry, who
part8349.0
 was looking up "Dittany" in One Thousa
part8350.0
nd Magical Herbs and
Fungi, didn't look
part8351.0
 up until he heard Ron say, "Hagrid! Wh
part8352.0
at are you
doing in the library?"

Hagr
part8353.0
id shuffled into view, hiding something
part8354.0
 behind his back. He looked
very out of
part8355.0
 place in his moleskin overcoat.

"Jus'
part8356.0
 lookin'," he said, in a shifty voice t
part8357.0
hat got their interest at
once. "An' wh
part8358.0
at're you lot up ter?" He looked sudden
part8359.0
ly suspicious. "Yer
not still lookin' f
part8360.0
er Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?" "Oh, we fo
part8361.0
und out who he
is ages ago," said Ron i
part8362.0
mpressively. "And we know what that dog
part8363.0
's
guarding, it's a Sorcerer's St --"


part8364.0
"Shhhh!" Hagrid looked around quickly t
part8365.0
o see if anyone was listening.
"Don' go
part8366.0
 shoutin' about it, what's the matter w
part8367.0
ith yeh?"

"There are a few things we w
part8368.0
anted to ask you, as a matter of fact,"
part8369.0
 said
Harry, "about what's guarding the
part8370.0
 Stone apart from Fluffy --"

"SHHHH!" 
part8371.0
said Hagrid again. "Listen - come an' s
part8372.0
ee me later, I'm not
promisin' I'll tel
part8373.0
l yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbi
part8374.0
tin' about it
in here, students aren' s
part8375.0
'pposed ter know. They'll think I've to
part8376.0
ld yeh
--"

"See you later, then," said
part8377.0
 Harry.

Hagrid shuffled off.

"What wa
part8378.0
s he hiding behind his back?" said Herm
part8379.0
ione thoughtfully.

"Do you think it ha
part8380.0
d anything to do with the Stone?"

"I'm
part8381.0
 going to see what section he was in," 
part8382.0
said Ron, who'd had enough of
working. 
part8383.0
He came back a minute later with a pile
part8384.0
 of books in his arms
and slammed them 
part8385.0
down on the table.

"Dragons!" he whisp
part8386.0
ered. "Hagrid was looking up stuff abou
part8387.0
t dragons!
Look at these: Dragon Specie
part8388.0
s of Great Britain and Ireland; From Eg
part8389.0
g to
Inferno, A Dragon Keeper's Guide."
part8390.0


"Hagrid's always wanted a dragon, he 
part8391.0
told me so the first time I ever
met hi
part8392.0
m, " said Harry.

"But it's against our
part8393.0
 laws," said Ron. "Dragon breeding was 
part8394.0
outlawed by
the Warlocks' Convention of
part8395.0
 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard t
part8396.0
o stop
Muggles from noticing us if we'r
part8397.0
e keeping dragons in the back garden -

part8398.0
anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's da
part8399.0
ngerous. You should see the burns
Charl
part8400.0
ie's got off wild ones in Romania."

"B
part8401.0
ut there aren't wild dragons in Britain
part8402.0
?" said Harry.

"Of course there are," 
part8403.0
said Ron. "Common Welsh Green and Hebri
part8404.0
dean
Blacks. The Ministry of Magic has 
part8405.0
a job hushing them up, I can tell you.

part8406.0
Our kind have to keep putting spells on
part8407.0
 Muggles who've spotted them, to
make t
part8408.0
hem forget."

"So what on earths Hagrid
part8409.0
 up to?" said Hermione.

When they knoc
part8410.0
ked on the door of the gamekeeper's hut
part8411.0
 an hour later,
they were surprised to 
part8412.0
see that all the curtains were closed. 
part8413.0
Hagrid
called "Who is it?" before he le
part8414.0
t them in, and then shut the door
quick
part8415.0
ly behind them.

It was stifling hot in
part8416.0
side. Even though it was such a warm da
part8417.0
y, there
was a blazing fire in the grat
part8418.0
e. Hagrid made them tea and offered the
part8419.0
m
stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
part8420.0


"So -- yeh wanted to ask me somethin'
part8421.0
?"

"Yes," said Harry. There was no poi
part8422.0
nt beating around the bush. "We were
wo
part8423.0
ndering if you could tell us what's gua
part8424.0
rding the Sorcerer's Stone
apart from F
part8425.0
luffy."

Hagrid frowned at him.

"0' co
part8426.0
urse I cant, he said. "Number one, I do
part8427.0
n' know meself. Number two,
yeh know to
part8428.0
o much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh i
part8429.0
f I could. That
Stone's here fer a good
part8430.0
 reason. It Was almost stolen outta Gri
part8431.0
ngotts - I
s'ppose yeh've worked that o
part8432.0
ut an' all? Beats me how yeh even know 
part8433.0
abou'
Fluffy."

"Oh, come on, Hagrid, y
part8434.0
ou might not want to tell us, but you d
part8435.0
o know,
you know everything that goes o
part8436.0
n round here," said Hermione in a warm,
part8437.0

flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitc
part8438.0
hed and they could tell he was
smiling.
part8439.0
 "We only wondered who had done the gua
part8440.0
rding, really." Hermione
went on. "We w
part8441.0
ondered who Dumbledore had trusted enou
part8442.0
gh to help him,
apart from you."

Hagri
part8443.0
d's chest swelled at these last words. 
part8444.0
Harry and Ron beamed at
Hermione.

"Wel
part8445.0
l, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell
part8446.0
 yeh that... let's see... he
borrowed F
part8447.0
luffy from me... then some o' the teach
part8448.0
ers did enchantments...
Professor Sprou
part8449.0
t -- Professor Flitwick -- Professor Mc
part8450.0
Gonagall --" he
ticked them off on his 
part8451.0
fingers, "Professor Quirrell -- an' Dum
part8452.0
bledore
himself did somethin', o' cours
part8453.0
e. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh

part8454.0
yeah, Professor Snape."

"Snape?"

"Yea
part8455.0
h -- yer not still on abou' that, are y
part8456.0
eh? Look, Snape helped
protect the Ston
part8457.0
e, he's not about ter steal it."

Harry
part8458.0
 knew Ron and Hermione were thinking th
part8459.0
e same as he was. If Snape
had been in 
part8460.0
on protecting the Stone, it must have b
part8461.0
een easy to find out
how the other teac
part8462.0
hers had guarded it. He probably knew e
part8463.0
verything --
except, it seemed, Quirrel
part8464.0
l's spell and how to get past Fluffy.


part8465.0
"You're the only one who knows how to g
part8466.0
et past Fluffy. aren't you,
Hagrid?" sa
part8467.0
id Harry anxiously. "And you wouldn't t
part8468.0
ell anyone, would you?
Not even one of 
part8469.0
the teachers?"

"Not a soul knows excep
part8470.0
t me an' Dumbledore," said Hagrid proud
part8471.0
ly.

"Well, that's something," Harry mu
part8472.0
ttered to the others. "Hagrid, can we
h
part8473.0
ave a window open? I'm boiling."

"Can'
part8474.0
t, Harry, sorry," said Hagrid. Harry no
part8475.0
ticed him glance at the
fire. Harry loo
part8476.0
ked at it, too.

"Hagrid -- what's that
part8477.0
?"

But he already knew what it was. In
part8478.0
 the very heart of the fire,
underneath
part8479.0
 the kettle, was a huge, black egg.

"A
part8480.0
h," said Hagrid, fiddling nervously wit
part8481.0
h his beard, "That's er..."

"Where did
part8482.0
 you get it, Hagrid?" said Ron, crouchi
part8483.0
ng over the fire to get
a closer look a
part8484.0
t the egg. "It must've cost you a fortu
part8485.0
ne."

"Won it," said Hagrid. "Las' nigh
part8486.0
t. I was down in the village havin' a
f
part8487.0
ew drinks an' got into a game o' cards 
part8488.0
with a stranger. Think he was
quite gla
part8489.0
d ter get rid of it, ter be honest."

"
part8490.0
But what are you going to do with it wh
part8491.0
en it's hatched?" said Hermione.

"Well
part8492.0
, I've bin doin' some readin' , said Ha
part8493.0
grid, pulling a large book
from under h
part8494.0
is pillow. "Got this outta the library 
part8495.0
-- Dragon Breeding
for Pleasure and Pro
part8496.0
fit -- it's a bit outta date, o' course
part8497.0
, but it's
all in here. Keep the egg in
part8498.0
 the fire, 'cause their mothers breathe
part8499.0
 on I
em, see, an' when it hatches, fee
part8500.0
d it on a bucket o' brandy mixed with
c
part8501.0
hicken blood every half hour. An' see h
part8502.0
ere -- how ter recognize
diff'rent eggs
part8503.0
 -- what I got there's a Norwegian Ridg
part8504.0
eback. They're
rare, them."

He looked 
part8505.0
very pleased with himself, but Hermione
part8506.0
 didn't.

"Hagrid, you live in a wooden
part8507.0
 house," she said.

But Hagrid wasn't l
part8508.0
istening. He was humming merrily as he 
part8509.0
stoked the
fire.

So now they had somet
part8510.0
hing else to worry about: what might ha
part8511.0
ppen to
Hagrid if anyone found out he w
part8512.0
as hiding an illegal dragon in his hut.
part8513.0

"Wonder what it's like to have a peace
part8514.0
ful life," Ron sighed, as evening
after
part8515.0
 evening they struggled through all the
part8516.0
 extra homework they were
getting. Herm
part8517.0
ione had now started making study sched
part8518.0
ules for Harry and
Ron, too. It was dri
part8519.0
ving them nuts.

Then, one breakfast ti
part8520.0
me, Hedwig brought Harry another note f
part8521.0
rom Hagrid.
He had written only two wor
part8522.0
ds: It's hatching.

Ron wanted to skip 
part8523.0
Herbology and go straight down to the h
part8524.0
ut. Hermione
wouldn't hear of it.

"Her
part8525.0
mione, how many times in our lives are 
part8526.0
we going to see a dragon
hatching?"

"W
part8527.0
e've got lessons, we'll get into troubl
part8528.0
e, and that's nothing to what
Hagrid's 
part8529.0
going to be in when someone finds out w
part8530.0
hat he's doing --"

"Shut up!" Harry wh
part8531.0
ispered.

Malfoy was only a few feet aw
part8532.0
ay and he had stopped dead to listen. H
part8533.0
ow
much had he heard? Harry didn't like
part8534.0
 the look on Malfoy's face at all.

Ron
part8535.0
 and Hermione argued all the way to Her
part8536.0
bology and in the end,
Hermione agreed 
part8537.0
to run down to Hagrid's with the other 
part8538.0
two during
morning break. When the bell
part8539.0
 sounded from the castle at the end of 
part8540.0
their
lesson, the three of them dropped
part8541.0
 their trowels at once and hurried
thro
part8542.0
ugh the grounds to the edge of the fore
part8543.0
st. Hagrid greeted them,
looking flushe
part8544.0
d and excited.

"It's nearly out." He u
part8545.0
shered them inside.

The egg was lying 
part8546.0
on the table. There were deep cracks in
part8547.0
 it. Something
was moving inside; a fun
part8548.0
ny clicking noise was coming from it.


part8549.0
They all drew their chairs up to the ta
part8550.0
ble and watched with bated
breath.

All
part8551.0
 at once there was a scraping noise and
part8552.0
 the egg split open. The baby
dragon fl
part8553.0
opped onto the table. It wasn't exactly
part8554.0
 pretty; Harry thought
it looked like a
part8555.0
 crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wi
part8556.0
ngs were huge
compared to its skinny je
part8557.0
t body, it had a long snout with wide n
part8558.0
ostrils,
the stubs of horns and bulging
part8559.0
, orange eyes.

It sneezed. A couple of
part8560.0
 sparks flew out of its snout.

"Isn't 
part8561.0
he beautiful?" Hagrid murmured. He reac
part8562.0
hed out a hand to stroke
the dragon's h
part8563.0
ead. It snapped at his fingers, showing
part8564.0
 pointed fangs.

"Bless him, look, he k
part8565.0
nows his mommy!" said Hagrid.

"Hagrid,
part8566.0
" said Hermione, "how fast do Norwegian
part8567.0
 Ridgebacks grow,
exactly?"

Hagrid was
part8568.0
 about to answer when the color suddenl
part8569.0
y drained from his face
-- he leapt to 
part8570.0
his feet and ran to the window.

"What'
part8571.0
s the matter?"

"Someone was lookin' th
part8572.0
rough the gap in the curtains -- it's a
part8573.0
 kid --
he's runnin' back up ter the sc
part8574.0
hool."

Harry bolted to the door and lo
part8575.0
oked out. Even at a distance there was 
part8576.0
no
mistaking him.

Malfoy had seen the 
part8577.0
dragon.

Something about the smile lurk
part8578.0
ing on Malfoy's face during the next we
part8579.0
ek
made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very n
part8580.0
ervous. They spent most of their
free t
part8581.0
ime in Hagrid's darkened hut, trying to
part8582.0
 reason with him.

"Just let him go," H
part8583.0
arry urged. "Set him free."

"I can't,"
part8584.0
 said Hagrid. "He's too little. He'd di
part8585.0
e."

They looked at the dragon. It had 
part8586.0
grown three times in length in just a
w
part8587.0
eek. Smoke kept furling out of its nost
part8588.0
rils. Hagrid hadn't been doing
his game
part8589.0
keeping duties because the dragon was k
part8590.0
eeping him so busy. There
were empty br
part8591.0
andy bottles and chicken feathers all o
part8592.0
ver the floor.

"I've decided to call h
part8593.0
im Norbert," said Hagrid, looking at th
part8594.0
e dragon
with misty eyes. "He really kn
part8595.0
ows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert!
Wh
part8596.0
ere's Mommy?"

"He's lost his marbles,"
part8597.0
 Ron muttered in Harry's ear.

"Hagrid,
part8598.0
" said Harry loudly, "give it two weeks
part8599.0
 and Norbert's going to
be as long as y
part8600.0
our house. Malfoy could go to Dumbledor
part8601.0
e at any moment."

Hagrid bit his lip.

part8602.0

"I -- I know I can't keep him forever,
part8603.0
 but I can't jus' dump him, I
can't."


part8604.0
Harry suddenly turned to Ron. Charlie, 
part8605.0
he said.

"You're losing it, too," said
part8606.0
 Ron. "I'm Ron, remember?"

"No -- Char
part8607.0
lie -- your brother, Charlie. In Romani
part8608.0
a. Studying dragons.
We could send Norb
part8609.0
ert to him. Charlie can take care of hi
part8610.0
m and then put
him back in the wild!"


part8611.0
"Brilliant!" said Ron. "How about it, H
part8612.0
agrid?"

And in the end, Hagrid agreed 
part8613.0
that they could send -an owl to Charlie
part8614.0
 to
ask him.

The following week dragge
part8615.0
d by. Wednesday night found Hermione an
part8616.0
d Harry
sitting alone in the common roo
part8617.0
m, long after everyone else had gone to
part8618.0

bed. The clock on the wall had just

c
part8619.0
himed midnight when the portrait hole b
part8620.0
urst open. Ron appeared out of
nowhere 
part8621.0
as he pulled off Harry's invisibility c
part8622.0
loak. He had been down at
Hagrid's hut,
part8623.0
 helping him feed Norbert, who was now 
part8624.0
eating dead rats by
the crate.

"It bit
part8625.0
 me!" he said, showing them his hand, w
part8626.0
hich was wrapped in a
bloody handkerchi
part8627.0
ef. "I'm not going to be able to hold a
part8628.0
 quill for a
week. I tell you, that dra
part8629.0
gon's the most horrible animal I've eve
part8630.0
r met,
but the way Hagrid goes on about
part8631.0
 it, you'd think it was a fluffy little
part8632.0

bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told m
part8633.0
e off for frightening it. And when
I le
part8634.0
ft, he was singing it a lullaby."

Ther
part8635.0
e was a tap on the dark window.

"It's 
part8636.0
Hedwig!" said Harry, hurrying to let he
part8637.0
r in. "She'll have
Charlie's answer!"


part8638.0
The three of them put their heads toget
part8639.0
her to read the note.

Dear Ron,

How a
part8640.0
re you? Thanks for the letter -- I'd be
part8641.0
 glad to take the Norwegian
Ridgeback, 
part8642.0
but it won't be easy getting him here. 
part8643.0
I think the best thing
will be to send 
part8644.0
him over with some friends of mine who 
part8645.0
are coming to
visit me next week. Troub
part8646.0
le is, they mustn't be seen carrying an
part8647.0
 illegal
dragon.

Could you get the Rid
part8648.0
geback up the tallest tower at midnight
part8649.0
 on
Saturday? They can meet you there a
part8650.0
nd take him away while it's still
dark.
part8651.0


Send me an answer as soon as possible
part8652.0
.

Love,

Charlie

They looked at one a
part8653.0
nother.

"We've got the invisibility cl
part8654.0
oak," said Harry. "It shouldn't be too

part8655.0
difficult -- I think the cloaks big eno
part8656.0
ugh to cover two of us and
Norbert."

I
part8657.0
t was a mark of how bad the last week h
part8658.0
ad been that the other two
agreed with 
part8659.0
him. Anything to get rid of Norbert -- 
part8660.0
and Malfoy.

There was a hitch. By the 
part8661.0
next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swo
part8662.0
llen to
twice its usual size. He didn't
part8663.0
 know whether it was safe to go to Mada
part8664.0
m
Pomfrey -- would she recognize a drag
part8665.0
on bite? By the afternoon, though,
he h
part8666.0
ad no choice. The cut had turned a nast
part8667.0
y shade of green. It looked
as if Norbe
part8668.0
rt's fangs were poisonous.

Harry and H
part8669.0
ermione rushed up to the hospital wing 
part8670.0
at the end of the day
to find Ron in a 
part8671.0
terrible state in bed.

"It's not just 
part8672.0
my hand," he whispered, "although that 
part8673.0
feels like it's
about to fall off. Malf
part8674.0
oy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted to borr
part8675.0
ow one of
my books so he could come and
part8676.0
 have a good laugh at me. He kept
threa
part8677.0
tening to tell her what really bit me -
part8678.0
- I've told her it was a
dog, but I don
part8679.0
't think she believes me -I shouldn't h
part8680.0
ave hit him at the
Quidditch match, tha
part8681.0
t's why he's doing this."

Harry and He
part8682.0
rmione tried to calm Ron down.

"It'll 
part8683.0
all be over at midnight on Saturday," s
part8684.0
aid Hermione, but this
didn't soothe Ro
part8685.0
n at all. On the contrary, he sat bolt 
part8686.0
upright and broke
into a sweat.

"Midni
part8687.0
ght on Saturday!" he said in a hoarse v
part8688.0
oice. "Oh no oh no -- I've
just remembe
part8689.0
red -- Charlie's letter was in that boo
part8690.0
k Malfoy took, he's
going to know we're
part8691.0
 getting rid of Norbert."

Harry and He
part8692.0
rmione didn't get a chance to answer. M
part8693.0
adam Pomfrey came
over at that moment a
part8694.0
nd made them leave, saying Ron needed s
part8695.0
leep.

"It's too late to change the pla
part8696.0
n now," Harry told Hermione. "We haven'
part8697.0
t
got time to send Charlie another owl,
part8698.0
 and this could be our only chance
to g
part8699.0
et rid of Norbert. We'll have to risk i
part8700.0
t. And we have got the
invisibility clo
part8701.0
ak, Malfoy doesn't know about that."

T
part8702.0
hey found Fang, the boarhound, sitting 
part8703.0
outside with a bandaged tail
when they 
part8704.0
went to tell Hagrid, who opened a windo
part8705.0
w to talk to them.

"I won't let you in
part8706.0
," he puffed. "Norbert's at a tricky st
part8707.0
age -- nothin'
I can't handle."

When t
part8708.0
hey told him about Charlie's letter, hi
part8709.0
s eyes filled with tears,
although that
part8710.0
 might have been because Norbert had ju
part8711.0
st bitten him on the
leg.

"Aargh! It's
part8712.0
 all right, he only got my boot -- jus'
part8713.0
 playin' -- he's only
a baby, after all
part8714.0
."

The baby banged its tail on the wal
part8715.0
l, making the windows rattle. Harry
and
part8716.0
 Hermione walked back to the castle fee
part8717.0
ling Saturday couldn't come
quickly eno
part8718.0
ugh.

They would have felt sorry for Ha
part8719.0
grid when the time came for him to say

part8720.0
good-bye to Norbert if they hadn't been
part8721.0
 so worried about what they had
to do. 
part8722.0
It was a very dark, cloudy night, and t
part8723.0
hey were a bit late
arriving at Hagrid'
part8724.0
s hut because they'd had to wait for Pe
part8725.0
eves to get
out of their way in the ent
part8726.0
rance hall, where he'd been playing ten
part8727.0
nis
against the wall. Hagrid had Norber
part8728.0
t packed and ready in a large crate.

"
part8729.0
He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy f
part8730.0
er the journey," said Hagrid in
a muffl
part8731.0
ed voice. "An' I've packed his teddy be
part8732.0
ar in case he gets
lonely."

From insid
part8733.0
e the crate came ripping noises that so
part8734.0
unded to Harry as
though the teddy was 
part8735.0
having his head torn off.

"Bye-bye, No
part8736.0
rbert!" Hagrid sobbed, as Harry and Her
part8737.0
mione covered the
crate with the invisi
part8738.0
bility cloak and stepped underneath it 
part8739.0
themselves.
"Mommy will never forget yo
part8740.0
u!"

How they managed to get the crate 
part8741.0
back up to the castle, they never
knew.
part8742.0
 Midnight ticked nearer as they heaved 
part8743.0
Norbert up the marble
staircase in the 
part8744.0
entrance hall and along the dark corrid
part8745.0
ors. UP another
staircase, then another
part8746.0
 -- even one of Harry's shortcuts didn'
part8747.0
t make the
work much easier.

"Nearly t
part8748.0
here!" Harry panted as they reached the
part8749.0
 corridor beneath the
tallest tower.

T
part8750.0
hen a sudden movement ahead of them mad
part8751.0
e them almost drop the crate.
Forgettin
part8752.0
g that they were already invisible, the
part8753.0
y shrank into the
shadows, staring at t
part8754.0
he dark outlines of two people grapplin
part8755.0
g with each
other ten feet away. A lamp
part8756.0
 flared.

Professor McGonagall, in a ta
part8757.0
rtan bathrobe and a hair net, had Malfo
part8758.0
y by
the ear.

"Detention!" she shouted
part8759.0
. "And twenty points from Slytherin! Wa
part8760.0
ndering
around in the middle of the nig
part8761.0
ht, how dare you --"

"You don't unders
part8762.0
tand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming 
part8763.0
-- he's got a
dragon!"

"What utter rub
part8764.0
bish! How dare you tell such lies! Come
part8765.0
 on -- I shall see
Professor Snape abou
part8766.0
t you, Malfoy!"

The steep spiral stair
part8767.0
case up to the top of the tower seemed 
part8768.0
the easiest
thing in the world after th
part8769.0
at. Not until they'd stepped out into t
part8770.0
he
cold night air did they throw off th
part8771.0
e cloak, glad to be able to breathe
pro
part8772.0
perly again. Hermione did a sort of jig
part8773.0
.

"Malfoy's got detention! I could sin
part8774.0
g!"

"Don't," Harry advised her.

Chuck
part8775.0
ling about Malfoy, they waited, Norbert
part8776.0
 thrashing about in his
crate. About te
part8777.0
n minutes later, four broomsticks came 
part8778.0
swooping down out
of the darkness.

Cha
part8779.0
rlie's friends were a cheery lot. They 
part8780.0
showed Harry and Hermione the
harness t
part8781.0
hey'd rigged up, so they could suspend 
part8782.0
Norbert between them.
They all helped b
part8783.0
uckle Norbert safely into it and then H
part8784.0
arry and
Hermione shook hands with the 
part8785.0
others and thanked them very much.

At 
part8786.0
last, Norbert was going... going... gon
part8787.0
e.

They slipped back down the spiral s
part8788.0
taircase, their hearts as light as
thei
part8789.0
r hands, now that Norbert was off them.
part8790.0
 No more dragon -- Malfoy in
detention 
part8791.0
-- what could spoil their happiness?

T
part8792.0
he answer to that was waiting at the fo
part8793.0
ot of the stairs. As they
stepped into 
part8794.0
the corridor, Filch's face loomed sudde
part8795.0
nly out of the
darkness.

"Well, well, 
part8796.0
well," he whispered, "we are in trouble
part8797.0
."

They'd left the invisibility cloak 
part8798.0
on top of the tower.


CHAPTER FIFTEEN

part8799.0

THE FORIBIDDEN FOREST

Things couldn't
part8800.0
 have been worse.

Filch took them down
part8801.0
 to Professor McGonagall's study on the
part8802.0
 first floor,
where they sat and waited
part8803.0
 without saying a word to each other. H
part8804.0
ermione
was trembling. Excuses, alibis,
part8805.0
 and wild cover- up stories chased each
part8806.0

other around Harry's brain, each more 
part8807.0
feeble than the last. He couldn't
see h
part8808.0
ow they were going to get out of troubl
part8809.0
e this time. They were
cornered. How co
part8810.0
uld they have been so stupid as to forg
part8811.0
et the cloak?
There was no reason on ea
part8812.0
rth that Professor McGonagall would acc
part8813.0
ept for
their being out of bed and cree
part8814.0
ping around the school in the dead of
n
part8815.0
ight, let alone being up the tallest as
part8816.0
tronomy tower, which was
out-of-bounds 
part8817.0
except for classes. Add Norbert and the
part8818.0
 invisibility
cloak, and they might as 
part8819.0
well be packing their bags already.

Ha
part8820.0
d Harry thought that things couldn't ha
part8821.0
ve been worse? He was wrong.
When Profe
part8822.0
ssor McGonagall appeared, she was leadi
part8823.0
ng Neville.

"Harry!" Neville burst Out
part8824.0
, the moment he saw the other two. "I w
part8825.0
as
trying to find you to warn you, I he
part8826.0
ard Malfoy saying he was going to
catch
part8827.0
 you, he said you had a drag --"

Harry
part8828.0
 shook his head violently to shut Nevil
part8829.0
le up, but Professor
McGonagall had see
part8830.0
n. She looked more likely to breathe fi
part8831.0
re than Norbert
as she towered over the
part8832.0
 three of them.

"I would never have be
part8833.0
lieved it of any of you. Mr. Filch says
part8834.0
 you were
up in the astronomy tower. It
part8835.0
's one o'clock in the morning. Explain

part8836.0
yourselves."

It was the first time Her
part8837.0
mione had ever failed to answer a teach
part8838.0
er's
question. She was staring at her s
part8839.0
lippers, as still as a statue.

"I thin
part8840.0
k I've got a good idea of what's been g
part8841.0
oing on," said Professor
McGonagall. "I
part8842.0
t doesn't take a genius to work it out.
part8843.0
 You fed Draco
Malfoy some cock-and-bul
part8844.0
l story about a dragon, trying to get h
part8845.0
im out of
bed and into trouble. I've al
part8846.0
ready caught him. I suppose you think i
part8847.0
t's
funny that Longbottom here heard th
part8848.0
e story and believed it, too?"

Harry c
part8849.0
aught Neville's eye and tried to tell h
part8850.0
im without words that this
wasn't true,
part8851.0
 because Neville was looking stunned an
part8852.0
d hurt. Poor,
blundering Neville -- Har
part8853.0
ry knew what it must have cost him to t
part8854.0
ry and
find them in the dark, to warn t
part8855.0
hem.

"I'm disgusted," said Professor M
part8856.0
cGonagall. "Four students out of bed in
part8857.0

one night! I've never heard of such a 
part8858.0
thing before! You, Miss Granger, I
thou
part8859.0
ght you had more sense. As for you, Mr.
part8860.0
 Potter, I thought Gryffindor
meant mor
part8861.0
e to you than this. All three of you wi
part8862.0
ll receive detentions --
yes, you too, 
part8863.0
Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you the r
part8864.0
ight to walk around
school at night, es
part8865.0
pecially these days, it's very dangerou
part8866.0
s -- and fifty
points will be taken fro
part8867.0
m Gryffindor."

"Fifty?" Harry gasped -
part8868.0
- they would lose the lead, the lead he
part8869.0
'd won in
the last Quidditch match.

"F
part8870.0
ifty points each," said Professor McGon
part8871.0
agall, breathing heavily
through her lo
part8872.0
ng, pointed nose.

"Professor -- please
part8873.0


"You can't --"

"Don't tell me what I
part8874.0
 can and can't do, Potter. Now get back
part8875.0
 to bed, all
of you. I've never been mo
part8876.0
re ashamed of Gryffindor students."

A 
part8877.0
hundred and fifty points lost. That put
part8878.0
 Gryffindor in last place. In
one night
part8879.0
, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor h
part8880.0
ad had for the house
cup. Harry felt as
part8881.0
 though the bottom had dropped out of h
part8882.0
is stomach. How
could they ever make up
part8883.0
 for this?

Harry didn't sleep all nigh
part8884.0
t. He could hear Neville sobbing into h
part8885.0
is
pillow for what seemed like hours. H
part8886.0
arry couldn't think of anything to
say 
part8887.0
to comfort him. He knew Neville, like h
part8888.0
imself, was dreading the
dawn. What wou
part8889.0
ld happen when the rest of Gryffindor f
part8890.0
ound out what
they'd done?

At first, G
part8891.0
ryffindors passing the giant hourglasse
part8892.0
s that recorded the
house points the ne
part8893.0
xt day thought there'd been a mistake. 
part8894.0
How could they
suddenly have a hundred 
part8895.0
and fifty points fewer than yesterday? 
part8896.0
And then
the story started to spread: H
part8897.0
arry Potter, the famous Harry Potter,
t
part8898.0
heir hero of two Quidditch matches, had
part8899.0
 lo st them all those points,
him and a
part8900.0
 couple of other stupid first years.

F
part8901.0
rom being one of the most popular and a
part8902.0
dmired people at the school,
Harry was 
part8903.0
suddenly the most hated. Even Ravenclaw
part8904.0
s and Hufflepuffs
turned on him, becaus
part8905.0
e everyone had been longing to see Slyt
part8906.0
herin lose
the house cup. Everywhere Ha
part8907.0
rry went, people pointed and didn't tro
part8908.0
uble
to lower their voices as they insu
part8909.0
lted him. Slytherins, on the other
hand
part8910.0
, clapped as he walked past them, whist
part8911.0
ling and cheering, "Thanks
Potter, we o
part8912.0
we you one!"

Only Ron stood by him.

"
part8913.0
They'll all forget this in a few weeks.
part8914.0
 Fred and George have lost loads
of poi
part8915.0
nts in all the time they've been here, 
part8916.0
and people still like
them."

"They've 
part8917.0
never lost a hundred and fifty points i
part8918.0
n one go, though, have
they?" said Harr
part8919.0
y miserably.

"Well -- no," Ron admitte
part8920.0
d.

It was a bit late to repair the dam
part8921.0
age, but Harry swore to himself not
to 
part8922.0
meddle in things that weren't his busin
part8923.0
ess from now on. He'd had it
with sneak
part8924.0
ing around and spying. He felt so asham
part8925.0
ed of himself that he
went to Wood and 
part8926.0
offered to resign from the Quidditch te
part8927.0
am.

"Resign?" Wood thundered. "What go
part8928.0
od'll that do? How are we going to get

part8929.0
any points back if we can't win at Quid
part8930.0
ditch?"

But even Quidditch had lost it
part8931.0
s fun. The rest of the team wouldn't sp
part8932.0
eak
to Harry during practice, and if th
part8933.0
ey had to speak about him, they
called 
part8934.0
him "the Seeker."

Hermione and Neville
part8935.0
 were suffering, too. They didn't have 
part8936.0
as bad a time
as Harry, because they we
part8937.0
ren't as well-known, but nobody would s
part8938.0
peak to
them, either. Hermione had stop
part8939.0
ped drawing attention to herself in
cla
part8940.0
ss, keeping her head down and working i
part8941.0
n silence.

Harry was almost glad that 
part8942.0
the exams weren't far away. All the stu
part8943.0
dying
he had to do kept his mind off hi
part8944.0
s misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept to
part8945.0

themselves, working late into the nigh
part8946.0
t, trying to remember the
ingredients i
part8947.0
n complicated potions, learn charms and
part8948.0
 spells by heart,
memorize the dates of
part8949.0
 magical discoveries and goblin rebelli
part8950.0
ons....

Then, about a week before the 
part8951.0
exams were due to start, Harry's new
re
part8952.0
solution not to interfere in anything t
part8953.0
hat didn't concern him was put
to an un
part8954.0
expected test. Walking back from the li
part8955.0
brary on his own one
afternoon, he hear
part8956.0
d somebody whimpering from a classroom 
part8957.0
up ahead. As he
drew closer, he heard Q
part8958.0
uirrell's voice.

"No -- no -- not agai
part8959.0
n, please --"

It sounded as though som
part8960.0
eone was threatening him. Harry moved c
part8961.0
loser.

"All right -- all right --" he 
part8962.0
heard Quirrell sob.

Next second, Quirr
part8963.0
ell came hurrying out of the classroom 
part8964.0
straightening
his turban. He was pale a
part8965.0
nd looked as though he was about to cry
part8966.0
. He
strode out of sight; Harry didn't 
part8967.0
think Quirrell had even noticed him.
He
part8968.0
 waited until Quirrell's footsteps had 
part8969.0
disappeared, then peered into
the class
part8970.0
room. It was empty, but a door stood aj
part8971.0
ar at the other end.
Harry was halfway 
part8972.0
toward it before he remembered what he'
part8973.0
d promised
himself about not meddling.

part8974.0

All the same, he'd have gambled twelve
part8975.0
 Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had
just 
part8976.0
left the room, and from what Harry had 
part8977.0
just heard, Snape would be
walking with
part8978.0
 a new spring in his step -- Quirrell s
part8979.0
eemed to have given
in at last.

Harry 
part8980.0
went back to the library, where Hermion
part8981.0
e was testing Ron on
Astronomy. Harry t
part8982.0
old them what he'd heard.

"Snape's don
part8983.0
e it, then!" said Ron. "If Quirrell's t
part8984.0
old him how to break
his Anti-Dark Forc
part8985.0
e spell --"

"There's still Fluffy, tho
part8986.0
ugh," said Hermione.

"Maybe Snape's fo
part8987.0
und out how to get past him without ask
part8988.0
ing Hagrid,"
said Ron, looking up at th
part8989.0
e thousands of books surrounding them. 
part8990.0
"I bet
there's a book somewhere in here
part8991.0
 telling you how to get past a giant
th
part8992.0
ree-headed dog. So what do we do, Harry
part8993.0
?"

The light of adventure was kindling
part8994.0
 again in Ron's eyes, but Hermione
answ
part8995.0
ered before Harry could.

"Go to Dumble
part8996.0
dore. That's what we should have done a
part8997.0
ges ago. If we try
anything ourselves w
part8998.0
e'll be thrown out for sure."

"But we'
part8999.0
ve got no proof!" said Harry. "Quirrell
part9000.0
's too scared to back us
up. Snape's on
part9001.0
ly got to say he doesn't know how the t
part9002.0
roll got in at
Halloween and that he wa
part9003.0
s nowhere near the third floor -- who d
part9004.0
o you
think they'll believe, him or us?
part9005.0
 It's not exactly a secret we hate him,
part9006.0

Dumbledore'll think we made it up to g
part9007.0
et him sacked. Filch wouldn't help
us i
part9008.0
f his life depended on it, he's too fri
part9009.0
endly with Snape, and the
more students
part9010.0
 get thrown out, the better, he'll thin
part9011.0
k. And don't forget,
we're not supposed
part9012.0
 to know about the Stone or Fluffy. Tha
part9013.0
t'll take a lot
of explaining."

Hermio
part9014.0
ne looked convinced, but Ron didn't.

"
part9015.0
If we just do a bit of poking around --
part9016.0
"

"No," said Harry flatly, "we've done
part9017.0
 enough poking around."

He pulled a ma
part9018.0
p of Jupiter toward him and started to 
part9019.0
learn the names of
its moons.

The foll
part9020.0
owing morning, notes were delivered to 
part9021.0
Harry, Hermione, and
Neville at the bre
part9022.0
akfast table. They were all the same:


part9023.0
Your detention will take place at eleve
part9024.0
n o'clock tonight. Meet Mr. Filch
in th
part9025.0
e entrance hall.

Professor McGonagall 
part9026.0
Harry had forgotten they still had dete
part9027.0
ntions to do
in the furor over the poin
part9028.0
ts they'd lost. He half expected Hermio
part9029.0
ne to
complain that this was a whole ni
part9030.0
ght of studying lost, but she didn't
sa
part9031.0
y a word. Like Harry, she felt they des
part9032.0
erved what they'd got.

At eleven o'clo
part9033.0
ck that night, they said good-bye to Ro
part9034.0
n in the common
room and went down to t
part9035.0
he entrance hall with Neville. Filch wa
part9036.0
s already
there -- and so was Malfoy. H
part9037.0
arry had also forgotten that Malfoy had
part9038.0

gotten a detention, too.

"Follow me,"
part9039.0
 said Filch, lighting a lamp and leadin
part9040.0
g them outside.

I bet you'll think twi
part9041.0
ce about breaking a school rule again, 
part9042.0
won't you,
eh?" he said, leering at the
part9043.0
m. "Oh yes... hard work and pain are th
part9044.0
e
best teachers if you ask me.... It's 
part9045.0
just a pity they let the old
punishment
part9046.0
s die out... hang you by your wrists fr
part9047.0
om the ceiling for a
few days, I've got
part9048.0
 the chains still in my office, keep 'e
part9049.0
m well oiled in
case they're ever neede
part9050.0
d.... Right, off we go, and don't think
part9051.0
 of
running off, now, it'll be worse fo
part9052.0
r you if you do."

They marched off acr
part9053.0
oss the dark grounds. Neville kept snif
part9054.0
fing. Harry
wondered what their punishm
part9055.0
ent was going to be. It must be somethi
part9056.0
ng
really horrible, or Filch wouldn't b
part9057.0
e sounding so delighted.

The moon was 
part9058.0
bright, but clouds scudding across it k
part9059.0
ept throwing them
into darkness. Ahead,
part9060.0
 Harry could see the lighted windows of
part9061.0
 Hagrid's
hut. Then they heard a distan
part9062.0
t shout.

"Is that you, Filch? Hurry up
part9063.0
, I want ter get started."

Harry's hea
part9064.0
rt rose; if they were going to be worki
part9065.0
ng with Hagrid it
wouldn't be so bad. H
part9066.0
is relief must have showed in his -face
part9067.0
, because
Filch said, "I suppose you th
part9068.0
ink you'll be enjoying yourself with th
part9069.0
at
oaf? Well, think again, boy -- it's 
part9070.0
into the forest you're going and I'm
mu
part9071.0
ch mistaken if you'll all come out in o
part9072.0
ne piece."

At this, Neville let out a 
part9073.0
little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead in
part9074.0
 his
tracks.

"The forest?" he repeated
part9075.0
, and he didn't sound quite as cool as 
part9076.0
usual.
"We can't go in there at night -
part9077.0
- there's all sorts of things in there

part9078.0
-- werewolves, I heard."

Neville clutc
part9079.0
hed the sleeve of Harry's robe and made
part9080.0
 a choking noise.

"That's your problem
part9081.0
, isn't it?" said Filch, his voice crac
part9082.0
king with
glee. "Should've thought of t
part9083.0
hem werewolves before you got in troubl
part9084.0
e,
shouldn't you?"

Hagrid came stridin
part9085.0
g toward them out of the dark, Fang at 
part9086.0
his heel. He
was carrying his large cro
part9087.0
ssbow, and a quiver of arrows hung over
part9088.0
 his
shoulder.

"Abou' time," he said. 
part9089.0
"I bin waitin' fer half an hour already
part9090.0
. All
right, Harry, Hermione?"

"I shou
part9091.0
ldn't be too friendly to them, Hagrid,"
part9092.0
 said Filch coldly,
they're here to be 
part9093.0
punished, after all."

"That's why yer 
part9094.0
late, is it?" said Hagrid, frowning at 
part9095.0
Filch. "Bin
lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot y
part9096.0
our place ter do that. Yeh've done yer 
part9097.0
bit,
I'll take over from here."

"I'll 
part9098.0
be back at dawn," said Filch, "for what
part9099.0
's left of them," he added
nastily, and
part9100.0
 he turned and started back toward the 
part9101.0
castle, his lamp
bobbing away in the da
part9102.0
rkness.

Malfoy now turned to Hagrid.


part9103.0
"I'm not going in that forest, he said,
part9104.0
 and Harry was pleased to hear
the note
part9105.0
 of panic in his voice.

"Yeh are if ye
part9106.0
h want ter stay at Hogwarts," said Hagr
part9107.0
id fiercely.
"Yeh've done wrong an' now
part9108.0
 yehve got ter pay fer it."

"But this 
part9109.0
is servant stuff, it's not for students
part9110.0
 to do. I thought we'd
be copying lines
part9111.0
 or something, if my father knew I was 
part9112.0
doing this, he'd

tell yer that's how i
part9113.0
t is at Hogwarts," Hagrid growled. "Cop
part9114.0
yin' lines!
What good's that ter anyone
part9115.0
? Yeh'll do summat useful or Yeh'll get
part9116.0
 out.
If yeh think yer father'd rather 
part9117.0
you were expelled, then get back off
te
part9118.0
r the castle an' pack. Go on"'

Malfoy 
part9119.0
didn't move. He looked at Hagrid furiou
part9120.0
sly, but then dropped his
gaze.

"Right
part9121.0
 then," said Hagrid, "now, listen caref
part9122.0
ully, 'cause it's dangerous
what we're 
part9123.0
gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no on
part9124.0
e takin' risks. Follow
me over here a m
part9125.0
oment."

He led them to the very edge o
part9126.0
f the forest. Holding his lamp up high,
part9127.0
 he
pointed down a narrow, winding eart
part9128.0
h track that disappeared into the
thick
part9129.0
 black trees. A light breeze lifted the
part9130.0
ir hair as they looked into
the forest.
part9131.0


"Look there," said Hagrid, "see that 
part9132.0
stuff shinin' on the ground?
Silvery st
part9133.0
uff? That's unicorn blood. There's a un
part9134.0
icorn in there bin hurt
badly by summat
part9135.0
. This is the second time in a week. I 
part9136.0
found one dead
last Wednesday. We're go
part9137.0
nna try an' find the poor thing. We mig
part9138.0
ht have
ter put it out of its misery."

part9139.0

"And what if whatever hurt the unicorn
part9140.0
 finds us first?" said Malfoy,
unable t
part9141.0
o keep the fear out of his voice.

"The
part9142.0
re's nothin' that lives in the forest t
part9143.0
hat'll hurt yeh if yer with
me or Fang,
part9144.0
" said Hagrid. "An' keep ter the path. 
part9145.0
Right, now, we're
gonna split inter two
part9146.0
 parties an' follow the trail in diff'r
part9147.0
ent
directions. There's blood all over 
part9148.0
the place, it must've bin staggerin'
ar
part9149.0
ound since last night at least."

"I wa
part9150.0
nt Fang," said Malfoy quickly, looking 
part9151.0
at Fang's long teeth.

"All right, but 
part9152.0
I warn yeh, he's a coward," said Hagrid
part9153.0
. " So me, Harry,
an' Hermione'll go on
part9154.0
e way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll g
part9155.0
o the other.
Now, if any of us finds th
part9156.0
e unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, 
part9157.0
right?
Get yer wands out an' practice n
part9158.0
ow -- that's it -- an' if anyone gets i
part9159.0
n
trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'l
part9160.0
l all come an' find yeh -- so, be
caref
part9161.0
ul -- let's go."

The forest was black 
part9162.0
and silent. A little way into it they r
part9163.0
eached a
fork in the earth path, and Ha
part9164.0
rry, Hermione, and Hagrid took the left
part9165.0

path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang t
part9166.0
ook the right.

They walked in silence,
part9167.0
 their eyes on the ground. Every now an
part9168.0
d then a
ray of moonlight through the b
part9169.0
ranches above lit a spot of silver-blue
part9170.0

blood on the fallen leaves.

Harry saw
part9171.0
 that Hagrid looked very worried.

"Cou
part9172.0
ld a werewolf be killing the unicorns?"
part9173.0
 Harry asked.

"Not fast enough," said 
part9174.0
Hagrid. "It's not easy ter catch a unic
part9175.0
orn,
they're powerful magic creatures. 
part9176.0
I never knew one ter be hurt before."


part9177.0
They walked past a mossy tree stump. Ha
part9178.0
rry could hear running water;
there mus
part9179.0
t be a stream somewhere close by. There
part9180.0
 were still spots of
unicorn blood here
part9181.0
 and there along the winding path.

"Yo
part9182.0
u all right, Hermione?" Hagrid whispere
part9183.0
d. "Don' worry, it can't've
gone far if
part9184.0
 it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll b
part9185.0
e able ter -- GET
BEHIND THAT TREE!"

H
part9186.0
agrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoi
part9187.0
sted them off the path behind a
towerin
part9188.0
g oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitte
part9189.0
d it into his crossbow,
raising it, rea
part9190.0
dy to fire. The three of them listened.
part9191.0
 Something was
slithering over dead lea
part9192.0
ves nearby: it sounded like a cloak tra
part9193.0
iling
along the ground. Hagrid was squi
part9194.0
nting up the dark path, but after a few
part9195.0

seconds, the sound faded away.

"I kne
part9196.0
w it, " he murmured. "There's summat in
part9197.0
 here that shouldn' be."

"A werewolf?"
part9198.0
 Harry suggested.

"That wasn' no werew
part9199.0
olf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither," 
part9200.0
said Hagrid
grimly. "Right, follow me, 
part9201.0
but careful, now."

They walked more sl
part9202.0
owly, ears straining for the faintest s
part9203.0
ound.
Suddenly, in a clearing ahead, so
part9204.0
mething definitely moved.

"Who's there
part9205.0
?" Hagrid called. "Show yerself -- I'm 
part9206.0
armed!"

And into the clearing came -- 
part9207.0
was it a man, or a horse? To the waist,
part9208.0
 a
man, with red hair and beard, but be
part9209.0
low that was a horse's gleaming
chestnu
part9210.0
t body with a long, reddish tail. Harry
part9211.0
 and Hermione's jaws
dropped.

"Oh, it'
part9212.0
s you, Ronan," said Hagrid in relief. "
part9213.0
How are yeh?"

He walked forward and sh
part9214.0
ook the centaur's hand.

"Good evening 
part9215.0
to you, Hagrid," said Ronan. He had a d
part9216.0
eep, sorrowful
voice. "Were you going t
part9217.0
o shoot me?"

"Can't be too careful, Ro
part9218.0
nan," said Hagrid, patting his crossbow
part9219.0
.
"There's summat bad loose in this for
part9220.0
est. This is Harry Potter an'
Hermione 
part9221.0
Granger, by the way. Students up at the
part9222.0
 school. An' this is
Ronan, you two. He
part9223.0
's a centaur.))

"We'd noticed," said H
part9224.0
ermione faintly.

"Good evening," said 
part9225.0
Ronan. "Students, are you? And do you l
part9226.0
earn much,
up at the school?"

"Erm --"
part9227.0


"A bit," said Hermione timidly.

"A b
part9228.0
it. Well, that's something." Ronan sigh
part9229.0
ed. He flung back his head
and stared a
part9230.0
t the sky. "Mars is bright tonight."

"
part9231.0
Yeah," said Hagrid, glancing up, too. "
part9232.0
Listen, I'm glad we've run inter
yeh, R
part9233.0
onan, 'cause there's a unicorn bin hurt
part9234.0
 -- you seen anythin'?"

Ronan didn't a
part9235.0
nswer immediately. He stared unblinking
part9236.0
ly upward, then
sighed again.

"Always 
part9237.0
the innocent are the first victims," he
part9238.0
 said. "So it has been
for ages past, s
part9239.0
o it is now."

"Yeah," said Hagrid, "bu
part9240.0
t have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythi
part9241.0
n'
unusual?"

"Mars is bright tonight,"
part9242.0
 Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched h
part9243.0
im
impatiently. "Unusually bright."

"Y
part9244.0
eah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual
part9245.0
 a bit nearer home, said
Hagrid. "So ye
part9246.0
h haven't noticed anythin' strange?"

Y
part9247.0
et again, Ronan took a while to answer.
part9248.0
 At last, he said, "The forest
hides ma
part9249.0
ny secrets."

A movement in the trees b
part9250.0
ehind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow a
part9251.0
gain,
but it was only a second centaur,
part9252.0
 black-haired and -bodied and
wilder-lo
part9253.0
oking than Ronan.

"Hullo, Bane," said 
part9254.0
Hagrid. "All right?"

"Good evening, Ha
part9255.0
grid, I hope you are well?"

"Well enou
part9256.0
gh. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, y
part9257.0
ou seen anythin' odd in
here lately? Th
part9258.0
ere's a unicorn bin injured -- would ye
part9259.0
h know anythin'
about it?"

Bane walked
part9260.0
 over to stand next to Ronan. He looked
part9261.0
 skyward. "Mars is
bright tonight," he 
part9262.0
said simply.

"We've heard," said Hagri
part9263.0
d grumpily. "Well, if either of you do 
part9264.0
see
anythin', let me know, won't yeh? W
part9265.0
e'll be off, then."

Harry and Hermione
part9266.0
 followed him out of the clearing, star
part9267.0
ing over their
shoulders at Ronan and B
part9268.0
ane until the trees blocked their view.
part9269.0


"Never," said Hagrid irritably, "try 
part9270.0
an' get a straight answer out of a
cent
part9271.0
aur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested i
part9272.0
n anythin' closer'n the
moon."

"Are th
part9273.0
ere many of them in here?" asked Hermio
part9274.0
ne.

"Oh, a fair few... Keep themselves
part9275.0
 to themselves mostly, but they're
good
part9276.0
 enough about turnin' up if ever I want
part9277.0
 a word. They're deep, mind,
centaurs..
part9278.0
. they know things... jus' don' let on 
part9279.0
much."

"D'you think that was a centaur
part9280.0
 we heard earlier?" said Harry.

"Did t
part9281.0
hat sound like hooves to you? Nah, if y
part9282.0
eh ask me, that was what's
bin killin' 
part9283.0
the unicorns -- never heard anythin' li
part9284.0
ke it before."

They walked on through 
part9285.0
the dense, dark trees. Harry kept looki
part9286.0
ng
nervously over his shoulder. He had 
part9287.0
the nasty feeling they were being
watch
part9288.0
ed. He was very glad they had Hagrid an
part9289.0
d his crossbow with them.
They had just
part9290.0
 passed a bend in the path when Hermion
part9291.0
e grabbed Hagrid's
arm.

"Hagrid! Look!
part9292.0
 Red sparks, the others are in trouble!
part9293.0
"

"You two wait here!" Hagrid shouted.
part9294.0
 "Stay on the path, I'll come back
for 
part9295.0
yeh!"

They heard him crashing away thr
part9296.0
ough the undergrowth and stood looking

part9297.0
at each other, very scared, until they 
part9298.0
couldn't hear anything but the
rustling
part9299.0
 of leaves around them.

"You don't thi
part9300.0
nk they've been hurt, do you?" whispere
part9301.0
d Hermione.

"I don't care if Malfoy ha
part9302.0
s, but if something's got Neville... it
part9303.0
's our
fault he's here in the first pla
part9304.0
ce."

The minutes dragged by. Their ear
part9305.0
s seemed sharper than usual. Harry's
se
part9306.0
emed to be picking up every sigh of the
part9307.0
 wind, every cracking twig.
What was go
part9308.0
ing on? Where were the others?

At last
part9309.0
, a great crunching noise announced Hag
part9310.0
rid's return. Malfoy,
Neville, and Fang
part9311.0
 were with him. Hagrid was fuming. Malf
part9312.0
oy, it seemed,
had sneaked up behind Ne
part9313.0
ville and grabbed him as a joke. Nevill
part9314.0
e had
panicked and sent up the sparks.

part9315.0

"We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now
part9316.0
, with the racket you two were
makin'. 
part9317.0
Right, we're changin' groups -- Neville
part9318.0
, you stay with me an'
Hermione, Harry,
part9319.0
 you go with Fang an' this idiot. I'm s
part9320.0
orry," Hagrid
added in a whisper to Har
part9321.0
ry, "but he'll have a harder time frigh
part9322.0
tenin'
you, an' we've gotta get this do
part9323.0
ne."

So Harry set off into the heart o
part9324.0
f the forest with Malfoy and Fang. They
part9325.0

walked for nearly half an hour, deeper
part9326.0
 and deeper into the forest, until
the 
part9327.0
path became almost impossible to follow
part9328.0
 because the trees were so
thick. Harry
part9329.0
 thought the blood seemed to be getting
part9330.0
 thicker. There were
splashes on the ro
part9331.0
ots of a tree, as though the poor creat
part9332.0
ure had been
thrashing around in pain c
part9333.0
lose by. Harry could see a clearing ahe
part9334.0
ad,
through the tangled branches of an 
part9335.0
ancient oak.

"Look --" he murmured, ho
part9336.0
lding out his arm to stop Malfoy.

Some
part9337.0
thing bright white was gleaming on the 
part9338.0
ground. They inched closer.

It was the
part9339.0
 unicorn all right, and it was dead. Ha
part9340.0
rry had never seen
anything so beautifu
part9341.0
l and sad. Its long, slender legs were 
part9342.0
stuck out at
odd angles where it had fa
part9343.0
llen and its mane was spread pearly-whi
part9344.0
te on
the dark leaves.

Harry had taken
part9345.0
 one step toward it when a slithering s
part9346.0
ound made him
freeze where he stood. A 
part9347.0
bush on the edge of the clearing quiver
part9348.0
ed....
Then, out of the shadows, a hood
part9349.0
ed figure came crawling across the
grou
part9350.0
nd like some stalking beast. Harry, Mal
part9351.0
foy, and Fang stood
transfixed. The clo
part9352.0
aked figure reached the unicorn, lowere
part9353.0
d its head
over the wound in the animal
part9354.0
's side, and began to drink its blood.

part9355.0

"AAAAAAAAAARGH!"

Malfoy let out a ter
part9356.0
rible scream and bolted -- so did Fang.
part9357.0
 The hooded
figure raised its head and 
part9358.0
looked right at Harry -- unicorn blood 
part9359.0
was
dribbling down its front. It got to
part9360.0
 its feet and came swiftly toward
Harry
part9361.0
 -- he couldn't move for fear.

Then a 
part9362.0
pain like he'd never felt before pierce
part9363.0
d his head; it was as
though his scar w
part9364.0
ere on fire. Half blinded, he staggered
part9365.0
 backward. He
heard hooves behind him, 
part9366.0
galloping, and something jumped clean o
part9367.0
ver
Harry, charging at the figure.

The
part9368.0
 pain in Harry's head was so bad he fel
part9369.0
l to his knees. It took a
minute or two
part9370.0
 to pass. When he looked up, the figure
part9371.0
 had gone. A centaur
was standing over 
part9372.0
him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked
part9373.0
 younger; he
had white-blond hair and a
part9374.0
 palomino body.

"Are you all right?" s
part9375.0
aid the centaur, pulling Harry to his f
part9376.0
eet.

"Yes -- thank you -- what was tha
part9377.0
t?"

The centaur didn't answer. He had 
part9378.0
astonishingly blue eyes, like pale
sapp
part9379.0
hires. He looked carefully at Harry, hi
part9380.0
s eyes lingering on the scar
that stood
part9381.0
 out, livid, on Harry's forehead.

"You
part9382.0
 are the Potter boy," he said. "You had
part9383.0
 better get back to Hagrid.
The forest 
part9384.0
is not safe at this time -- especially 
part9385.0
for you. Can you ride?
It will be quick
part9386.0
er this way.

"My name is Firenze," he 
part9387.0
added, as he lowered himself on to his 
part9388.0
front
legs so that Harry could clamber 
part9389.0
onto his back.

There was suddenly a so
part9390.0
und of more galloping from the other si
part9391.0
de of the
clearing. Ronan and Bane came
part9392.0
 bursting through the trees, their flan
part9393.0
ks
heaving and sweaty.

"Firenze!" Bane
part9394.0
 thundered. "What are you doing? You ha
part9395.0
ve a human on your
back! Have you no sh
part9396.0
ame? Are you a common mule?"

"Do you r
part9397.0
ealize who this is?" said Firenze. "Thi
part9398.0
s is the Potter boy. The
quicker he lea
part9399.0
ves this forest, the better."

"What ha
part9400.0
ve you been telling him?" growled Bane.
part9401.0
 "Remember, Firenze, we
are sworn not t
part9402.0
o set ourselves against the heavens. Ha
part9403.0
ve we not read
what is to come in the m
part9404.0
ovements of the planets?"

Ronan pawed 
part9405.0
the ground nervously. "I'm sure Firenze
part9406.0
 thought he was
acting for the best, " 
part9407.0
he said in his gloomy voice.

Bane kick
part9408.0
ed his back legs in anger.

"For the be
part9409.0
st! What is that to do with us? Centaur
part9410.0
s are concerned with
what has been fore
part9411.0
told! It is not our business to run aro
part9412.0
und like
donkeys after stray humans in 
part9413.0
our forest!"

Firenze suddenly reared o
part9414.0
n to his hind legs in anger, so that Ha
part9415.0
rry had
to grab his shoulders to stay o
part9416.0
n.

"Do you not see that unicorn?" Fire
part9417.0
nze bellowed at Bane. "Do you not
under
part9418.0
stand why it was killed? Or have the pl
part9419.0
anets not let you in on that
secret? I 
part9420.0
set myself against what is lurking in t
part9421.0
his forest, Bane, yes,
with humans alon
part9422.0
gside me if I must."

And Firenze whisk
part9423.0
ed around; with Harry clutching on as b
part9424.0
est he could,
they plunged off into the
part9425.0
 trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind t
part9426.0
hem.

Harry didn't have a clue what was
part9427.0
 going on.

"Why's Bane so angry?" he a
part9428.0
sked. "What was that thing you saved me
part9429.0
 from,
anyway?"

Firenze slowed to a wa
part9430.0
lk, warned Harry to keep his head bowed
part9431.0
 in case of
low-hanging branches, but d
part9432.0
id not answer Harry's question. They ma
part9433.0
de
their way through the trees in silen
part9434.0
ce for so long that Harry thought
Firen
part9435.0
ze didn't want to talk to him anymore. 
part9436.0
They were passing through a
particularl
part9437.0
y dense patch of trees, however, when F
part9438.0
irenze suddenly
stopped.

"Harry Potter
part9439.0
, do you know what unicorn blood is use
part9440.0
d -for?"

"No," said Harry, startled by
part9441.0
 the odd question. "We've only used the
part9442.0

horn and tail hair in Potions."

"That
part9443.0
 is because it is a monstrous thing, to
part9444.0
 slay a unicorn," said
Firenze. "Only o
part9445.0
ne who has nothing to lose, and everyth
part9446.0
ing to gain,
would commit such a crime.
part9447.0
 The blood of a unicorn will keep you a
part9448.0
live,
even if you are an inch from deat
part9449.0
h, but at a terrible price. You have
sl
part9450.0
ain something pure and defenseless to s
part9451.0
ave yourself, and you will have
but a h
part9452.0
alf-life, a cursed life, from the momen
part9453.0
t the blood touches your
lips."

Harry 
part9454.0
stared at the back of Firenze's head, w
part9455.0
hich was dappled silver in
the moonligh
part9456.0
t.

"But who'd be that desperate?" he w
part9457.0
ondered aloud. "If you're going to be
c
part9458.0
ursed forever, deaths better, isn't it?
part9459.0
"

"It is," Firenze agreed, "unless all
part9460.0
 you need is to stay alive long
enough 
part9461.0
to drink something else -- something th
part9462.0
at will bring you back to
full strength
part9463.0
 and power -- something that will mean 
part9464.0
you can never die.
Mr. Potter, do you k
part9465.0
now what is hidden in the school at thi
part9466.0
s very
moment?"

"The Sorcerer's Stone!
part9467.0
 Of course -- the Elixir of Life! But I
part9468.0
 don't
understand who --"

"Can you thi
part9469.0
nk of nobody who has waited many years 
part9470.0
to return to power,
who has clung to li
part9471.0
fe, awaiting their chance?"

It was as 
part9472.0
though an iron fist had clenched sudden
part9473.0
ly around Harry's
heart. Over the rustl
part9474.0
ing of the trees, he seemed to hear onc
part9475.0
e more what
Hagrid had told him on the 
part9476.0
night they had met: "Some say he died.

part9477.0
Codswallop, in my opinion. Dunno if he 
part9478.0
had enough human left in him to
die."


part9479.0
"Do you mean," Harry croaked, "that was
part9480.0
 Vol-"

"Harry! Harry, are you all righ
part9481.0
t?"

Hermione was running toward them d
part9482.0
own the path, Hagrid puffing along
behi
part9483.0
nd her.

"I'm fine," said Harry, hardly
part9484.0
 knowing what he was saying. "The
unico
part9485.0
rn's dead, Hagrid, it's in that clearin
part9486.0
g back there."

"This is where I leave 
part9487.0
you," Firenze murmured as Hagrid hurrie
part9488.0
d off to
examine the unicorn. "You are 
part9489.0
safe now."

Harry slid off his back.

"
part9490.0
Good luck, Harry Potter," said Firenze.
part9491.0
 "The planets have been read
wrongly be
part9492.0
fore now, even by centaurs. I hope this
part9493.0
 is one of those
times."

He turned and
part9494.0
 cantered back into the depths of the f
part9495.0
orest, leaving Harry
shivering behind h
part9496.0
im.

Ron had fallen asleep in the dark 
part9497.0
common room, waiting for them to
return
part9498.0
. He shouted something about Quidditch 
part9499.0
fouls when Harry roughly
shook him awak
part9500.0
e. In a matter of seconds, though, he w
part9501.0
as wide-eyed as
Harry began to tell him
part9502.0
 and Hermione what had happened in the 
part9503.0
forest.

Harry couldn't sit down. He pa
part9504.0
ced up and down in front of the fire. H
part9505.0
e
was still shaking.

"Snape wants the 
part9506.0
stone for Voldemort... and Voldemort's 
part9507.0
waiting in the
forest... and all this t
part9508.0
ime we thought Snape just wanted to get
part9509.0

rich...."

"Stop saying the name!" sai
part9510.0
d Ron in a terrified whisper, as if he

part9511.0
thought Voldemort could hear them.

Har
part9512.0
ry wasn't listening.

"Firenze saved me
part9513.0
, but he shouldn't have done so.... Ban
part9514.0
e was furious...
he was talking about i
part9515.0
nterfering with what the planets say is
part9516.0
 going to
happen.... They must show tha
part9517.0
t Voldemort's coming back.... Bane thin
part9518.0
ks
Firenze should have let Voldemort ki
part9519.0
ll me.... I suppose that's written
in t
part9520.0
he stars as well."

"Will you stop sayi
part9521.0
ng the name!" Ron hissed.

"So all I've
part9522.0
 got to wait for now is Snape to steal 
part9523.0
the Stone," Harry
went on feverishly, "
part9524.0
then Voldemort will be able to come and
part9525.0
 finish me
off... Well, I suppose Bane'
part9526.0
ll be happy."

Hermione looked very fri
part9527.0
ghtened, but she had a word of comfort.
part9528.0


"Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's th
part9529.0
e only one You-Know-Who was ever
afraid
part9530.0
 of With Dumbledore around, You-Know-Wh
part9531.0
o won't touch you. Anyway,
who says the
part9532.0
 centaurs are right? It sounds like for
part9533.0
tune-telling to me,
and Professor McGon
part9534.0
agall says that's a very imprecise bran
part9535.0
ch of magic."

The sky had turned light
part9536.0
 before they stopped talking. They went
part9537.0
 to bed
exhausted, their throats sore. 
part9538.0
But the night's surprises weren't over.
part9539.0


When Harry pulled back his sheets, he
part9540.0
 found his invisibility cloak
folded ne
part9541.0
atly underneath them. There was a note 
part9542.0
pinned to it:

Just in case.


CHAPTER 
part9543.0
SIXTEEN

THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR

In years
part9544.0
 to come, Harry would never quite remem
part9545.0
ber how he had managed to
get through h
part9546.0
is exams when he half expected Voldemor
part9547.0
t to come bursting
through the door at 
part9548.0
any moment. Yet the days crept by, and 
part9549.0
there could
be no doubt that Fluffy was
part9550.0
 still alive and well behind the locked
part9551.0
 door.

It was sweltering hot, especial
part9552.0
ly in the large classroom where they di
part9553.0
d
their written papers. They had been g
part9554.0
iven special, new quills for the
exams,
part9555.0
 which had been bewitched with an AntiC
part9556.0
heating spell.

They had practical exam
part9557.0
s as well. Professor Flitwick called th
part9558.0
em one by
one into his class to see if 
part9559.0
they could make a pineapple tapdance ac
part9560.0
ross
a desk. Professor McGonagall watch
part9561.0
ed them turn a mouse into a snuffbox
--
part9562.0
 points were given for how pretty the s
part9563.0
nuffbox was, but taken away if
it had w
part9564.0
hiskers. Snape made them all nervous, b
part9565.0
reathing down their necks
while they tr
part9566.0
ied to remember how to make a Forgetful
part9567.0
ness potion.

Harry did the best he cou
part9568.0
ld, trying to ignore the stabbing pains
part9569.0
 in his
forehead, which had been bother
part9570.0
ing him ever since his trip into the
fo
part9571.0
rest. Neville thought Harry had a bad c
part9572.0
ase of exam nerves because
Harry couldn
part9573.0
't sleep, but the truth was that Harry 
part9574.0
kept being woken by
his old nightmare, 
part9575.0
except that it was now worse than ever 
part9576.0
because there
was a hooded figure dripp
part9577.0
ing blood in it.

Maybe it was because 
part9578.0
they hadn't seen what Harry had seen in
part9579.0
 the forest,
or because they didn't hav
part9580.0
e scars burning on their foreheads, but
part9581.0
 Ron
and Hermione didn't seem as worrie
part9582.0
d about the Stone as Harry. The idea
of
part9583.0
 Voldemort certainly scared them, but h
part9584.0
e didn't keep visiting them in
dreams, 
part9585.0
and they were so busy with their studyi
part9586.0
ng they didn't have much
time to fret a
part9587.0
bout what Snape or anyone else might be
part9588.0
 up to.

Their very last exam was Histo
part9589.0
ry of Magic. One hour of answering
ques
part9590.0
tions about batty old wizards who'd inv
part9591.0
ented selfstirring cauldrons
and they'd
part9592.0
 be free, free for a whole wonderful we
part9593.0
ek until their exam
results came out. W
part9594.0
hen the ghost of Professor Binns told t
part9595.0
hem to put
down their quills and roll u
part9596.0
p their parchment, Harry couldn't help

part9597.0
cheering with the rest.

"That was far 
part9598.0
easier than I thought it would be," sai
part9599.0
d Hermione as they
joined the crowds fl
part9600.0
ocking out onto the sunny grounds. "I n
part9601.0
eedn't have
learned about the 1637 Were
part9602.0
wolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of
part9603.0

Elfric the Eager."

Hermione always li
part9604.0
ked to go through their exam papers aft
part9605.0
erward, but Ron
said this made him feel
part9606.0
 ill, so they wandered down to the lake
part9607.0
 and
flopped under a tree. The Weasley 
part9608.0
twins and Lee Jordan were tickling the

part9609.0
tentacles of a giant squid, which was b
part9610.0
asking in the warm shallows. "No
more s
part9611.0
tudying," Ron sighed happily, stretchin
part9612.0
g out on the grass. "You
could look mor
part9613.0
e cheerful, Harry, we've got a week bef
part9614.0
ore we find out how
badly we've done, t
part9615.0
here's no need to worry yet."

Harry wa
part9616.0
s rubbing his forehead.

"I wish I knew
part9617.0
 what this means!" he burst out angrily
part9618.0
. "My scar keeps
hurting -- it's happen
part9619.0
ed before, but never as often as this."
part9620.0


"Go to Madam Pomfrey," Hermione sugge
part9621.0
sted.

"I'm not ill," said Harry. "I th
part9622.0
ink it's a warning... it means danger's
part9623.0

coming...."

Ron couldn't get worked u
part9624.0
p, it was too hot.

"Harry, relax, Herm
part9625.0
ione's right, the Stone's safe as long 
part9626.0
as
Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've n
part9627.0
ever had any proof Snape found out
how 
part9628.0
to get past Fluffy. He nearly had his l
part9629.0
eg ripped off once, he's not
going to t
part9630.0
ry it again in a hurry. And Neville wil
part9631.0
l play Quidditch for
England before Hag
part9632.0
rid lets Dumbledore down."

Harry nodde
part9633.0
d, but he couldn't shake off a lurking 
part9634.0
feeling that there was
something he'd f
part9635.0
orgotten to do, something important. Wh
part9636.0
en he tried to
explain this, Hermione s
part9637.0
aid, "That's just the exams. I woke up 
part9638.0
last
night and was halfway through my T
part9639.0
ransfiguration notes before I
remembere
part9640.0
d we'd done that one."

Harry was quite
part9641.0
 sure the unsettled feeling didn't have
part9642.0
 anything to do
with work, though. He w
part9643.0
atched an owl flutter toward the school
part9644.0
 across
the bright blue sky, a note cla
part9645.0
mped in its mouth. Hagrid was the only

part9646.0
one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid w
part9647.0
ould never betray Dumbledore.
Hagrid wo
part9648.0
uld never tell anyone how to get past F
part9649.0
luffy... never... but --

Harry suddenl
part9650.0
y jumped to his feet.

"Where're you go
part9651.0
ing?" said Ron sleepily.

"I've just th
part9652.0
ought of something," said Harry. He had
part9653.0
 turned white.
"We've got to go and see
part9654.0
 Hagrid, now."

"Why?" panted Hermione,
part9655.0
 hurrying to keep up.

"Don't you think
part9656.0
 it's a bit odd," said Harry, scramblin
part9657.0
g up the grassy
slope, "that what Hagri
part9658.0
d wants more than anything else is a dr
part9659.0
agon, and
a stranger turns up who just 
part9660.0
happens to have an egg in his pocket? H
part9661.0
ow
many people wander around with drago
part9662.0
n eggs if it's against wizard law?
Luck
part9663.0
y they found Hagrid, don't you think? W
part9664.0
hy didn't I see it before?"

"What are 
part9665.0
you talking about?" said Ron, but Harry
part9666.0
, sprinting across the
grounds toward t
part9667.0
he forest, didn't answer.

Hagrid was s
part9668.0
itting in an armchair outside his house
part9669.0
; his trousers and
sleeves were rolled 
part9670.0
up, and he was shelling peas into a lar
part9671.0
ge bowl.

"Hullo," he said, smiling. "F
part9672.0
inished yer exams? Got time fer a drink
part9673.0
?"

"Yes, please," said Ron, but Harry 
part9674.0
cut him off.

"No, we're in a hurry. Ha
part9675.0
grid, I've got to ask you something. Yo
part9676.0
u know
that night you won Norbert? What
part9677.0
 did the stranger you were playing card
part9678.0
s
with look like?"

"Dunno," said Hagri
part9679.0
d casually, "he wouldn' take his cloak 
part9680.0
off."

He saw the three of them look st
part9681.0
unned and raised his eyebrows.

"It's n
part9682.0
ot that unusual, yeh get a lot o' funny
part9683.0
 folk in the Hog's Head --
that's the p
part9684.0
ub down in the village. Mighta bin a dr
part9685.0
agon dealer, mightn'
he? I never saw hi
part9686.0
s face, he kept his hood up."

Harry sa
part9687.0
nk down next to the bowl of peas. "What
part9688.0
 did you talk to him
about, Hagrid? Did
part9689.0
 you mention Hogwarts at all?"

"Mighta
part9690.0
 come up," said Hagrid, frowning as he 
part9691.0
tried to remember.
"Yeah... he asked wh
part9692.0
at I did, an' I told him I was gamekeep
part9693.0
er here....
He asked a bit about the so
part9694.0
rta creatures I took after... so I told
part9695.0

him... an' I said what I'd always real
part9696.0
ly wanted was a dragon... an'
then... I
part9697.0
 can' remember too well, 'cause he kept
part9698.0
 buyin' me drinks....
Let's see... yeah
part9699.0
, then he said he had the dragon egg an
part9700.0
' we could play
cards fer it if I wante
part9701.0
d... but he had ter be sure I could han
part9702.0
dle it, he
didn' want it ter go ter any
part9703.0
 old home.... So I told him, after Fluf
part9704.0
fy, a
dragon would be easy..."

"And di
part9705.0
d he -- did he seem interested in Fluff
part9706.0
y?" Harry asked, try ing
to keep his vo
part9707.0
ice calm.

"Well -- yeah -- how many th
part9708.0
ree-headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around
part9709.0

Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's a pi
part9710.0
ece o' cake if yeh know how to
calm him
part9711.0
 down, jus' play him a bit o' music an'
part9712.0
 he'll go straight off
ter sleep --"

H
part9713.0
agrid suddenly looked horrified.

"I sh
part9714.0
ouldn'ta told yeh that!" he blurted out
part9715.0
. "Forget I said it! Hey --
where're ye
part9716.0
h goin'?"

Harry, Ron, and Hermione did
part9717.0
n't speak to each other at all until th
part9718.0
ey
came to a halt in the entrance hall,
part9719.0
 which seemed very cold and gloomy
afte
part9720.0
r the grounds.

"We've got to go to Dum
part9721.0
bledore," said Harry. "Hagrid told that
part9722.0
 stranger
how to get past Fluffy, and i
part9723.0
t was either Snape or Voldemort under t
part9724.0
hat
cloak -- it must've been easy, once
part9725.0
 he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope
Dum
part9726.0
bledore believes us. Firenze might back
part9727.0
 us up if Bane doesn't stop
him. Where'
part9728.0
s Dumbledore's office?"

They looked ar
part9729.0
ound, as if hoping to see a sign pointi
part9730.0
ng them in the
right direction. They ha
part9731.0
d never been told where Dumbledore live
part9732.0
d, nor
did they know anyone who had bee
part9733.0
n sent to see him.

"We'll just have to
part9734.0
 --" Harry began, but a voice suddenly 
part9735.0
rang across
the hall.

"What are you th
part9736.0
ree doing inside?"

It was Professor Mc
part9737.0
Gonagall, carrying a large pile of book
part9738.0
s.

"We want to see Professor Dumbledor
part9739.0
e," said Hermione, rather bravely,
Harr
part9740.0
y and Ron thought.

"See Professor Dumb
part9741.0
ledore?" Professor McGonagall repeated,
part9742.0
 as though
this was a very fishy thing 
part9743.0
to want to do. "Why?"

Harry swallowed 
part9744.0
-- now what?

"It's sort of secret," he
part9745.0
 said, but he wished at once he hadn't,
part9746.0
 because
Professor McGonagall's nostril
part9747.0
s flared.

"Professor Dumbledore left t
part9748.0
en minutes ago," she said coldly. "He
r
part9749.0
eceived an urgent owl from the Ministry
part9750.0
 of Magic and flew off for
London at on
part9751.0
ce."

"He's gone?" said Harry frantical
part9752.0
ly. "Now?"

"Professor Dumbledore is a 
part9753.0
very great wizard, Potter, he has many

part9754.0
demands on his time --

"But this is im
part9755.0
portant."

"Something you have to say i
part9756.0
s more important than the Ministry of M
part9757.0
agic,
Potter.

"Look," said Harry, thro
part9758.0
wing caution to the winds, "Professor -
part9759.0
- it's
about the Sorcerer's tone --"

W
part9760.0
hatever Professor McGonagall had expect
part9761.0
ed, it wasn't that. The books
she was c
part9762.0
arrying tumbled out of her arms, but sh
part9763.0
e didn't pick them up.
"How do you know
part9764.0
 --?" she spluttered.

"Professor, I th
part9765.0
ink -- I know -- that Sn- that someone'
part9766.0
s going to try
and steal the Stone. I'v
part9767.0
e got to talk to Professor Dumbledore."
part9768.0


She eyed him with a mixture of shock 
part9769.0
and suspicion.

"Professor Dumbledore w
part9770.0
ill be back tomorrow," she said finally
part9771.0
. I don't
know how you found out about 
part9772.0
the Stone, but rest assured, no one can
part9773.0

possibly steal it, it's too well prote
part9774.0
cted."

"But Professor --"

"Potter, I 
part9775.0
know what I'm talking about," she said 
part9776.0
shortly. She bent down
and gathered up 
part9777.0
the fallen books. I suggest you all go 
part9778.0
back outside and
enjoy the sunshine."


part9779.0
But they didn't.

"It's tonight," said 
part9780.0
Harry, once he was sure Professor McGon
part9781.0
agall was
out of earshot. "Snape's goin
part9782.0
g through the trapdoor tonight. He's fo
part9783.0
und
out everything he needs, and now he
part9784.0
's got Dumbledore out of the way. He
se
part9785.0
nt that note, I bet the Ministry of Mag
part9786.0
ic will get a real shock when
Dumbledor
part9787.0
e turns up."

"But what can we --"

Her
part9788.0
mione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled rou
part9789.0
nd.

Snape was standing there.

"Good a
part9790.0
fternoon," he said smoothly.

They star
part9791.0
ed at him.

"You shouldn't be inside on
part9792.0
 a day like this," he said, with an odd
part9793.0
,
twisted smile.

"We were --" Harry be
part9794.0
gan, without any idea what he was going
part9795.0
 to say.

"You want to be more careful,
part9796.0
" said Snape. "Hanging around

like thi
part9797.0
s, people will think you're up to somet
part9798.0
hing. And Gryffindor
really can't affor
part9799.0
d to lose any more points, can it?"

Ha
part9800.0
rry flushed. They turned to go outside,
part9801.0
 but Snape called them back.

"Be warne
part9802.0
d, Potter -- any more nighttime wanderi
part9803.0
ngs and I will
personally make sure you
part9804.0
 are expelled. Good day to you."

He st
part9805.0
rode off in the direction of the staffr
part9806.0
oom.

Out on the stone steps, Harry tur
part9807.0
ned to the others.

"Right, here's what
part9808.0
 we've got to do," he whispered urgentl
part9809.0
y. "One of us
has got to keep an eye on
part9810.0
 Snape -- wait outside the staff room a
part9811.0
nd
follow him if he leaves it. Hermione
part9812.0
, you'd better do that."

"Why me?"

"I
part9813.0
t's obvious," said Ron. "You can preten
part9814.0
d to be waiting for Professor
Flitwick,
part9815.0
 you know." He put on a high voice, "'O
part9816.0
h Professor Flitwick,
I'm so worried, I
part9817.0
 think I got question fourteen b wrong.
part9818.0
...'"

"Oh, shut up," said Hermione, bu
part9819.0
t she agreed to go and watch out for
Sn
part9820.0
ape.

"And we'd better stay outside the
part9821.0
 third-floor corridor," Harry told Ron.
part9822.0

"Come on."

But that part of the plan 
part9823.0
didn't work. No sooner had they reached
part9824.0
 the
door separating Fluffy from the re
part9825.0
st of the school than Professor
McGonag
part9826.0
all turned up again and this time, she 
part9827.0
lost her temper.

"I suppose you think 
part9828.0
you're harder to get past than a pack o
part9829.0
f
enchantments!" she stormed. "Enough o
part9830.0
f this nonsense! If I hear you 've
come
part9831.0
 anywhere near here again, I'll take an
part9832.0
other fifty points from
Gryffindor! Yes
part9833.0
, Weasley, from my own house!" Harry an
part9834.0
d Ron went back to
the common room, Har
part9835.0
ry had just said, "At least Hermione's 
part9836.0
on Snape's
tail," when the portrait of 
part9837.0
the Fat Lady swung open and Hermione ca
part9838.0
me
in.

"I'm sorry, Harry!" she wailed.
part9839.0
 "Snape came out and asked me what I wa
part9840.0
s
doing, so I said I was waiting for Fl
part9841.0
itwick, and Snape went to get him,
and 
part9842.0
I've only just got away, I don't know w
part9843.0
here Snape went."

"Well, that's it the
part9844.0
n, isn't it?" Harry said.

The other tw
part9845.0
o stared at him. He was pale and his ey
part9846.0
es were glittering.

"I'm going out of 
part9847.0
here tonight and I'm going to try and g
part9848.0
et to the Stone
first."

"You're mad!" 
part9849.0
said Ron.

"You can't!" said Hermione. 
part9850.0
"After what McGonagall and Snape have s
part9851.0
aid?
You'll be expelled!"

"SO WHAP" Ha
part9852.0
rry shouted. "Don't you understand? If 
part9853.0
Snape gets hold of
the Stone, Voldemort
part9854.0
's coming back! Haven't you heard what 
part9855.0
it was like
when he was trying to take 
part9856.0
over? There won't be any Hogwarts to ge
part9857.0
t
expelled from! He'll flatten it, or t
part9858.0
urn it into a school for the Dark
Arts!
part9859.0
 Losing points doesn't matter anymore, 
part9860.0
can't you see? D'you think
he'll leave 
part9861.0
you and your families alone if Gryffind
part9862.0
or wins the house
cup? If I get caught 
part9863.0
before I can get to the Stone, well, I'
part9864.0
ll have to
go back to the Dursleys and 
part9865.0
wait for Voldemort to find me there, it
part9866.0
's
only dying a bit later than I would 
part9867.0
have, because I'm never going over
to t
part9868.0
he Dark Side! I'm going through that tr
part9869.0
apdoor tonight and nothing
you two say 
part9870.0
is going to stop me! Voldemort killed m
part9871.0
y parents, remember?"

He glared at the
part9872.0
m.

"You're right Harry," said Hermione
part9873.0
 in a small voice.

"I'll use the invis
part9874.0
ibility cloak," said Harry. "It's just 
part9875.0
lucky I got it
back."

"But will it cov
part9876.0
er all three of us?" said Ron.

"All --
part9877.0
 all three of us?"

"Oh, come off it, y
part9878.0
ou don't think we'd let you go alone?"

part9879.0

"Of course not," said Hermione briskly
part9880.0
. "How do you think you'd get to
the St
part9881.0
one without us? I'd better go and took 
part9882.0
through my books, there
might be someth
part9883.0
ing useful..."

"But if we get caught, 
part9884.0
you two will be expelled, too."

"Not i
part9885.0
f I can help it," said Hermione grimly.
part9886.0
 "Flitwick told me in
secret that I got
part9887.0
 a hundred and twelve percent on his ex
part9888.0
am. They're not
throwing me out after t
part9889.0
hat."

After dinner the three of them s
part9890.0
at nervously apart in the common room.

part9891.0
Nobody bothered them; none of the Gryff
part9892.0
indors had anything to say to
Harry any
part9893.0
 more, after all. This was the first ni
part9894.0
ght he hadn't been upset
by it. Hermion
part9895.0
e was skimming through all her notes, h
part9896.0
oping to come
across one of the enchant
part9897.0
ments they were about to try to break. 
part9898.0
Harry
and Ron didn't talk much. Both of
part9899.0
 them were thinking about what they
wer
part9900.0
e about to do.

Slowly, the room emptie
part9901.0
d as people drifted off to bed.

"Bette
part9902.0
r get the cloak," Ron muttered, as Lee 
part9903.0
Jordan finally left,
stretching and yaw
part9904.0
ning. Harry ran upstairs to their dark 
part9905.0
dormitory. He
putted out the cloak and 
part9906.0
then his eyes fell on the flute Hagrid 
part9907.0
had
given him for Christmas. He pockete
part9908.0
d it to use on Fluffy -- he didn't
feel
part9909.0
 much like singing.

He ran back down t
part9910.0
o the common room.

"We'd better put th
part9911.0
e cloak on here, and make sure it cover
part9912.0
s all three of
us -- if Filch spots one
part9913.0
 of our feet wandering along on its own
part9914.0
 --"

"What are you doing?" said a voic
part9915.0
e from the corner of the room. Neville

part9916.0
appeared from behind an armchair, clutc
part9917.0
hing Trevor the toad, who looked
as tho
part9918.0
ugh he'd been making another bid for fr
part9919.0
eedom.

"Nothing, Neville, nothing," sa
part9920.0
id Harry, hurriedly putting the cloak
b
part9921.0
ehind his back.

Neville stared at thei
part9922.0
r guilty faces.

"You're going out agai
part9923.0
n," he said.

"No, no, no," said Hermio
part9924.0
ne. "No, we're not. Why don't you go to
part9925.0
 bed,
Neville?"

Harry looked at the gr
part9926.0
andfather clock by the door. They could
part9927.0
n't afford
to waste any more time, Snap
part9928.0
e might even now be playing Fluffy to s
part9929.0
leep.

"You can't go out," said Neville
part9930.0
, "you'll be caught again. Gryffindor
w
part9931.0
ill be in even more trouble."

"You don
part9932.0
't understand," said Harry, "this is im
part9933.0
portant."

But Neville was clearly stee
part9934.0
ling himself to do something desperate.
part9935.0


I won't let you do it," he said, hurr
part9936.0
ying to stand in front of the
portrait 
part9937.0
hole. "I'll -- I'll fight you!"

"Nevil
part9938.0
le, "Ron exploded, "get away from that 
part9939.0
hole and don't be an idiot
--"

"Don't 
part9940.0
you call me an idiot!" said Neville. I 
part9941.0
don't think you should be
breaking any 
part9942.0
more rules! And you were the one who to
part9943.0
ld me to stand up to
people!"

"Yes, bu
part9944.0
t not to us," said Ron in exasperation.
part9945.0
 "Neville, you don't know
what you're d
part9946.0
oing."

He took a step forward and Nevi
part9947.0
lle dropped Trevor the toad, who leapt

part9948.0
out of sight.

"Go on then, try and hit
part9949.0
 me!" said Neville, raising his fists. 
part9950.0
"I'm
ready!"

Harry turned to Hermione.
part9951.0


"Do something," he said desperately.

part9952.0

Hermione stepped forward.

"Neville," 
part9953.0
she said, "I'm really, really sorry abo
part9954.0
ut this."

She raised her wand.

"Petri
part9955.0
ficus Totalus!" she cried, pointing it 
part9956.0
at Neville.

Neville's arms snapped to 
part9957.0
his sides. His legs sprang together. Hi
part9958.0
s whole
body rigid, he swayed where he 
part9959.0
stood and then fell flat on his face,
s
part9960.0
tiff as a board.

Hermione ran to turn 
part9961.0
him over. Neville's jaws were jammed to
part9962.0
gether so he
couldn't speak. Only his e
part9963.0
yes were moving, looking at them in hor
part9964.0
ror.

"What've you done to him?" Harry 
part9965.0
whispered.

"It's the full Body-Bind," 
part9966.0
said Hermione miserably. "Oh, Neville, 
part9967.0
I'm so
sorry."

"We had to, Neville, no
part9968.0
 time to explain," said Harry.

"You'll
part9969.0
 understand later, Neville," said Ron a
part9970.0
s they stepped over him
and pulled on t
part9971.0
he invisibility cloak.

But leaving Nev
part9972.0
ille lying motionless on the floor didn
part9973.0
't feel like a
very good omen. In their
part9974.0
 nervous state, every statue's shadow l
part9975.0
ooked
like Filch, every distant breath 
part9976.0
of wind sounded like Peeves swooping
do
part9977.0
wn on them. At the foot of the first se
part9978.0
t of stairs, they spotted Mrs.
Norris s
part9979.0
kulking near the top.

"Oh, let's kick 
part9980.0
her, just this once," Ron whispered in 
part9981.0
Harry's ear, but
Harry shook his head. 
part9982.0
As they climbed carefully around her, M
part9983.0
rs. Norris
turned her lamplike eyes on 
part9984.0
them, but didn't do anything.

They did
part9985.0
n't meet anyone else until they reached
part9986.0
 the staircase up to the
third floor. P
part9987.0
eeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening
part9988.0
 the carpet so that
people would trip.

part9989.0

"Who's there?" he said suddenly as the
part9990.0
y climbed toward him. He narrowed
his w
part9991.0
icked black eyes. "Know you're there, e
part9992.0
ven if I can't see you. Are
you ghoulie
part9993.0
 or ghostie or wee student beastie?"

H
part9994.0
e rose up in the air and floated there,
part9995.0
 squinting at them.

"Should call Filch
part9996.0
, I should, if something's a-creeping a
part9997.0
round unseen."

Harry had a sudden idea
part9998.0
.

"Peeves," he said, in a hoarse whisp
part9999.0
er, "the Bloody Baron has his own
reaso
part10000.0
ns for being invisible."

Peeves almost
part10001.0
 fell out of the air in shock. He caugh
part10002.0
t himself in time
and hovered about a f
part10003.0
oot off the stairs.

"So sorry, your bl
part10004.0
oodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir," he said grea
part10005.0
sily. "My
mistake, my mistake -- I didn
part10006.0
't see you -- of course I didn't, you'r
part10007.0
e
invisible -- forgive old Peevsie his 
part10008.0
little joke, sir."

"I have business he
part10009.0
re, Peeves," croaked Harry. "Stay away 
part10010.0
from this
place tonight."

"I will, sir
part10011.0
, I most certainly will," said Peeves, 
part10012.0
rising up in the air
again. "Hope your 
part10013.0
business goes well, Baron, I'll not bot
part10014.0
her you."

And he scooted off

"Brillia
part10015.0
nt, Harry!" whispered Ron.

A few secon
part10016.0
ds later, they were there, outside the 
part10017.0
third-floor corridor
-- and the door wa
part10018.0
s already ajar.

"Well, there you are,"
part10019.0
 Harry said quietly, "Snape's already g
part10020.0
ot past
Fluffy."

Seeing the open door 
part10021.0
somehow seemed to impress upon all thre
part10022.0
e of them
what was facing them. Underne
part10023.0
ath the cloak, Harry turned to the othe
part10024.0
r
two.

"If you want to go back, I won'
part10025.0
t blame you," he said. "You can take th
part10026.0
e
cloak, I won't need it now."

"Don't 
part10027.0
be stupid," said Ron.

"We're coming," 
part10028.0
said Hermione.

Harry pushed the door o
part10029.0
pen.

As the door creaked, low, rumblin
part10030.0
g growls met their ears. All three of
t
part10031.0
he dog's noses sniffed madly in their d
part10032.0
irection, even though it
couldn't see t
part10033.0
hem.

"What's that at its feet?" Hermio
part10034.0
ne whispered.

"Looks like a harp," sai
part10035.0
d Ron. "Snape must have left it there."
part10036.0


"It must wake up the moment you stop 
part10037.0
playing," said Harry. "Well, here
goes.
part10038.0
.."

He put Hagrid's flute to his lips 
part10039.0
and blew. It wasn't really a tune, but

part10040.0
from the first note the beast's eyes be
part10041.0
gan to droop. Harry hardly drew
breath.
part10042.0
 Slowly, the dog's growls ceased -- it 
part10043.0
tottered on its paws and
fell to its kn
part10044.0
ees, then it slumped to the ground, fas
part10045.0
t asleep.

"Keep playing," Ron warned H
part10046.0
arry as they slipped out of the cloak a
part10047.0
nd
crept toward the trapdoor. They coul
part10048.0
d feel the dog's hot, smelly breath
as 
part10049.0
they approached the giant heads. "I thi
part10050.0
nk we'll be able to pull the
door open,
part10051.0
" said Ron, peering over the dog's back
part10052.0
. "Want to go first,
Hermione?"

"No, I
part10053.0
 don't!"

"All right." Ron gritted his 
part10054.0
teeth and stepped carefully over the do
part10055.0
g's
legs. He bent and pulled the ring o
part10056.0
f the trapdoor, which swung up and
open
part10057.0
.

"What can you see?" Hermione said an
part10058.0
xiously.

"Nothing -- just black -- the
part10059.0
re's no way of climbing down, we'll jus
part10060.0
t
have to drop."

Harry, who was still 
part10061.0
playing the flute, waved at Ron to get 
part10062.0
his
attention and pointed at himself.


part10063.0
"You want to go first? Are you sure?" s
part10064.0
aid Ron. "I don't know how deep
this th
part10065.0
ing goes. Give the flute to Hermione so
part10066.0
 she can keep him asleep."

Harry hande
part10067.0
d the flute over. In the few seconds' s
part10068.0
ilence, the dog
growled and twitched, b
part10069.0
ut the moment Hermione began to play, i
part10070.0
t fell
back into its deep sleep.

Harry
part10071.0
 climbed over it and looked down throug
part10072.0
h the trapdoor. There was no
sign of th
part10073.0
e bottom.

He lowered himself through t
part10074.0
he hole until he was hanging on by his

part10075.0
fingertips. Then he looked up at Ron an
part10076.0
d said, "If anything happens to
me, don
part10077.0
't follow. Go straight to the owlery an
part10078.0
d send Hedwig to
Dumbledore, right?"

"
part10079.0
Right," said Ron.

"See you in a minute
part10080.0
, I hope...

And Harry let go. Cold, da
part10081.0
mp air rushed past him as he fell down,
part10082.0
 down,
down and -- FLUMP. With a funny,
part10083.0
 muffled sort of thump he landed on
som
part10084.0
ething soft. He sat up and felt around,
part10085.0
 his eyes not used to the
gloom. It fel
part10086.0
t as though he was sitting on some sort
part10087.0
 of plant.

"It's okay!" he called up t
part10088.0
o the light the size of a postage stamp
part10089.0
,
which was the open trapdoor, "it's a 
part10090.0
soft landing, you can jump!"

Ron follo
part10091.0
wed right away. He landed, sprawled nex
part10092.0
t to Harry.

"What's this stuff?" were 
part10093.0
his first words.

"Dunno, some sort of 
part10094.0
plant thing. I suppose it's here to bre
part10095.0
ak the fall.
Come on, Hermione!"

The d
part10096.0
istant music stopped. There was a loud 
part10097.0
bark from the dog, but
Hermione had alr
part10098.0
eady jumped. She landed on Harry's othe
part10099.0
r side.

"We must be miles under the sc
part10100.0
hool , she said.

"Lucky this plant thi
part10101.0
ng's here, really," said Ron.

"Lucky!"
part10102.0
 shrieked Hermione. "Look at you both!"
part10103.0


She leapt up and struggled toward a d
part10104.0
amp wall. She had to struggle
because t
part10105.0
he moment she had landed, the plant had
part10106.0
 started to twist
snakelike tendrils ar
part10107.0
ound her ankles. As for Harry and Ron, 
part10108.0
their legs
had already been bound tight
part10109.0
ly in long creepers without their notic
part10110.0
ing.

Hermione had managed to free hers
part10111.0
elf before the plant got a firm grip on
part10112.0

her. Now she watched in horror as the 
part10113.0
two boys fought to pull the plant
off t
part10114.0
hem, but the more they strained against
part10115.0
 it, the tighter and faster
the plant w
part10116.0
ound around them.

"Stop moving!" Hermi
part10117.0
one ordered them. "I know what this is 
part10118.0
-- it's
Devil's Snare!"

"Oh, I'm so gl
part10119.0
ad we know what it's called, that's a g
part10120.0
reat help," snarled
Ron, leaning back, 
part10121.0
trying to stop the plant from curling a
part10122.0
round his
neck. "Shut up, I'm trying to
part10123.0
 remember how to kill it!" said Hermion
part10124.0
e.

"Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!" 
part10125.0
Harry gasped, wrestling with it as it
c
part10126.0
urled around his chest.

"Devil's Snare
part10127.0
, Devil's Snare... what did Professor S
part10128.0
prout say? -- it
likes the dark and the
part10129.0
 damp

"So light a fire!" Harry choked.
part10130.0


"Yes -- of course -- but there's no w
part10131.0
ood!" Hermione cried, wringing her
hand
part10132.0
s.

"HAVE YOU GONE MAD?" Ron bellowed. 
part10133.0
"ARE YOU A WITCH OR NOT?"

"Oh, right!"
part10134.0
 said Hermione, and she whipped out her
part10135.0
 wand, waved it,
muttered something, an
part10136.0
d sent a jet of the same bluebell flame
part10137.0
s she had
used on Snape at the plant. I
part10138.0
n a matter of seconds, the two boys fel
part10139.0
t it
loosening its grip as it cringed a
part10140.0
way from the light and warmth.
Wrigglin
part10141.0
g and flailing, it unraveled itself fro
part10142.0
m their bodies, and they
were able to p
part10143.0
ull free.

"Lucky you pay attention in 
part10144.0
Herbology, Hermione," said Harry as he

part10145.0
joined her by the wall, wiping sweat of
part10146.0
f his face.

"Yeah," said Ron, "and luc
part10147.0
ky Harry doesn't lose his head in a cri
part10148.0
sis --
'there's no wood,' honestly."

"
part10149.0
This way," said Harry, pointing down a 
part10150.0
stone passageway, which was the
only wa
part10151.0
y forward.

All they could hear apart f
part10152.0
rom their footsteps was the gentle drip
part10153.0
 of
water trickling down the walls. The
part10154.0
 passageway sloped downward, and
Harry 
part10155.0
was reminded of Gringotts. With an unpl
part10156.0
easant jolt of the heart,
he remembered
part10157.0
 the dragons said to be guarding vaults
part10158.0
 in the wizards'
bank. If they met a dr
part10159.0
agon, a fully-grown dragon -- Norbert h
part10160.0
ad been bad
enough...

"Can you hear so
part10161.0
mething?" Ron whispered.

Harry listene
part10162.0
d. A soft rustling and clinking seemed 
part10163.0
to be coming from up
ahead.

"Do you th
part10164.0
ink it's a ghost?"

"I don't know... so
part10165.0
unds like wings to me."

"There's light
part10166.0
 ahead -- I can see something moving."

part10167.0

They reached the end of the passageway
part10168.0
 and saw before them a brilliantly
lit 
part10169.0
chamber, its ceiling arching high above
part10170.0
 them. It was full of small,
jewel-brig
part10171.0
ht birds, fluttering and tumbling all a
part10172.0
round the room. On the
opposite side of
part10173.0
 the chamber was a heavy wooden door.


part10174.0
"Do you think they'll attack us if we c
part10175.0
ross the room?" said Ron.

"Probably," 
part10176.0
said Harry. "They don't look very vicio
part10177.0
us, but I suppose if
they all swooped d
part10178.0
own at once... well, there's no other c
part10179.0
hoice... I'll
run."

He took a deep bre
part10180.0
ath, covered his face with his arms, an
part10181.0
d sprinted
across the room. He expected
part10182.0
 to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing 
part10183.0
at
him any second, but nothing happened
part10184.0
. He reached the door untouched. He
pul
part10185.0
led the handle, but it was locked.

The
part10186.0
 other two followed him. They tugged an
part10187.0
d heaved at the door, but it
wouldn't b
part10188.0
udge, not even when Hermione tried her 
part10189.0
Alohomora charm.

"Now what?" said Ron.
part10190.0


"These birds... they can't be here ju
part10191.0
st for decoration," said Hermione.

The
part10192.0
y watched the birds soaring overhead, g
part10193.0
littering -- glittering?

"They're not 
part10194.0
birds!" Harry said suddenly. "They're k
part10195.0
eys! Winged keys --
look carefully. So 
part10196.0
that must mean..." he looked around the
part10197.0
 chamber while
the other two squinted u
part10198.0
p at the flock of keys. "... yes -- loo
part10199.0
k!
Broomsticks! We've got to catch the 
part10200.0
key to the door!"

"But there are hundr
part10201.0
eds of them!"

Ron examined the lock on
part10202.0
 the door.

"We're looking for a big, o
part10203.0
ld-fashioned one -- probably silver, li
part10204.0
ke the
handle."

They each seized a bro
part10205.0
omstick and kicked off into the air, so
part10206.0
aring into
the midst of the cloud of ke
part10207.0
ys. They grabbed and snatched, but the

part10208.0
bewitched keys darted and dived so quic
part10209.0
kly it was almost impossible to
catch o
part10210.0
ne.

Not for nothing, though, was Harry
part10211.0
 the youngest Seeker in a century. He
h
part10212.0
ad a knack for spotting things other pe
part10213.0
ople didn't. After a minute's
weaving a
part10214.0
bout through the whirl of rainbow feath
part10215.0
ers, he noticed a large
silver key that
part10216.0
 had a bent wing, as if it had already 
part10217.0
been caught and
stuffed roughly into th
part10218.0
e keyhole.

"That one!" he called to th
part10219.0
e others. "That big one -- there -- no,
part10220.0
 there
-- with bright blue wings -- the
part10221.0
 feathers are all crumpled on one side.
part10222.0
"

Ron went speeding in the direction t
part10223.0
hat Harry was pointing, crashed into
th
part10224.0
e ceiling, and nearly fell off his broo
part10225.0
m.

"We've got to close in on it!" Harr
part10226.0
y called, not taking his eyes off the
k
part10227.0
ey with the damaged wing. "Ron, you com
part10228.0
e at it from above -- Hermione,
stay be
part10229.0
low and stop it from going down and I'l
part10230.0
l try and catch it. Right,
NOW!"

Ron d
part10231.0
ived, Hermione rocketed upward, the key
part10232.0
 dodged them both, and Harry
streaked a
part10233.0
fter it; it sped toward the wall, Harry
part10234.0
 leaned forward and
with a nasty, crunc
part10235.0
hing noise, pinned it against the stone
part10236.0
 with one
hand. Ron and Hermione's chee
part10237.0
rs echoed around the high chamber.

The
part10238.0
y landed quickly, and Harry ran to the 
part10239.0
door, the key struggling in
his hand. H
part10240.0
e rammed it into the lock and turned --
part10241.0
 it worked. The moment
the lock had cli
part10242.0
cked open, the key took flight again, l
part10243.0
ooking very
battered now that it had be
part10244.0
en caught twice.

"Ready?" Harry asked 
part10245.0
the other two, his hand on the door han
part10246.0
dle. They
nodded. He pulled the door op
part10247.0
en.

The next chamber was so dark they 
part10248.0
couldn't see anything at all. But as
th
part10249.0
ey stepped into it, light suddenly floo
part10250.0
ded the room to reveal an
astonishing s
part10251.0
ight.

They were standing on the edge o
part10252.0
f a huge chessboard, behind the black
c
part10253.0
hessmen, which were all taller than the
part10254.0
y were and carved from what
looked like
part10255.0
 black stone. Facing them, way across t
part10256.0
he chamber, were the
white pieces. Harr
part10257.0
y, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly -
part10258.0
- the towering
white chessmen had no fa
part10259.0
ces.

"Now what do we do?" Harry whispe
part10260.0
red.

"It's obvious, isn't it?" said Ro
part10261.0
n. "We've got to play our way across
th
part10262.0
e room."

Behind the white pieces they 
part10263.0
could see another door.

"How?" said He
part10264.0
rmione nervously.

"I think," said Ron,
part10265.0
 "we're going to have to be chessmen."

part10266.0

He walked up to a black knight and put
part10267.0
 his hand out to touch the
knight's hor
part10268.0
se. At once, the stone sprang to life. 
part10269.0
The horse pawed the
ground and the knig
part10270.0
ht turned his helmeted head to look dow
part10271.0
n at Ron.

"Do we -- er -- have to join
part10272.0
 you to get across?" The black knight
n
part10273.0
odded. Ron turned to the other two.

"T
part10274.0
his needs thinking about 	he said. I su
part10275.0
ppose we've got to take the
place of th
part10276.0
ree of the black pieces...."

Harry and
part10277.0
 Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron th
part10278.0
ink. Finally he said,
"Now, don't be of
part10279.0
fended or anything, but neither of you 
part10280.0
are that good at
chess --"

"We're not 
part10281.0
offended," said Harry quickly. "Just te
part10282.0
ll us what to do."

"Well, Harry, you t
part10283.0
ake the place of that bishop, and Hermi
part10284.0
one, YOU 90
next to him instead of that
part10285.0
 castle."

"What about you?"

"I'm goin
part10286.0
g to be a knight," said Ron.

The chess
part10287.0
men seemed to have been listening, beca
part10288.0
use at these words a
knight, a bishop, 
part10289.0
and a castle turned their backs on the 
part10290.0
white pieces
and walked off the board, 
part10291.0
leaving three empty squares that Harry,
part10292.0
 Ron,
and Hermione took.

"White always
part10293.0
 plays first in chess," said Ron, peeri
part10294.0
ng across the board.
"Yes... look..."


part10295.0
A white pawn had moved forward two squa
part10296.0
res.

Ron started to direct the black p
part10297.0
ieces. They moved silently wherever he

part10298.0
sent them. Harry's knees were trembling
part10299.0
. What if they lost?

"Harry -- move di
part10300.0
agonally four squares to the right."

T
part10301.0
heir first real shock came when their o
part10302.0
ther knight was taken. The white
queen 
part10303.0
smashed him to the floor and dragged hi
part10304.0
m off the board, where he
lay quite sti
part10305.0
ll, facedown.

"Had to let that happen,
part10306.0
" said Ron, looking shaken. "Leaves you
part10307.0
 free to
take that bishop, Hermione, go
part10308.0
 on."

Every time one of their men was 
part10309.0
lost, the white pieces showed no mercy.
part10310.0

Soon there was a huddle of limp black 
part10311.0
players slumped along the wall.
Twice, 
part10312.0
Ron only just noticed in time that Harr
part10313.0
y and Hermione were in
danger. He himse
part10314.0
lf darted around the board, taking almo
part10315.0
st as many white
pieces as they had los
part10316.0
t black ones.

"We're nearly there," he
part10317.0
 muttered suddenly. "Let me think let m
part10318.0
e
think..."

The white queen turned her
part10319.0
 blank face toward him.

"Yes..." said 
part10320.0
Ron softly, "It's the only way... I've 
part10321.0
got to be taken."

"NOF Harry and Hermi
part10322.0
one shouted.

"That's chess!" snapped R
part10323.0
on. "You've got to make some sacrifices
part10324.0
! I take
one step forward and she'll ta
part10325.0
ke me -- that leaves you free to checkm
part10326.0
ate
the king, Harry!"

"But --"

"Do yo
part10327.0
u want to stop Snape or not?"

"Ron --"
part10328.0


"Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll a
part10329.0
lready have the Stone!"

There was no a
part10330.0
lternative.

"Ready?" Ron called, his f
part10331.0
ace pale but determined. "Here I go - n
part10332.0
ow,
don't hang around once you've won."
part10333.0


He stepped forward, and the white que
part10334.0
en pounced. She struck Ron hard
across 
part10335.0
the head with her stone arm, and he cra
part10336.0
shed to the floor -
Hermione screamed b
part10337.0
ut stayed on her square - the white que
part10338.0
en dragged Ron
to one side. He looked a
part10339.0
s if he'd been knocked out.

Shaking, H
part10340.0
arry moved three spaces to the left.

T
part10341.0
he white king took off his crown and th
part10342.0
rew it at Harry's feet. They had
won. T
part10343.0
he chessmen parted and bowed, leaving t
part10344.0
he door ahead clear. With
one last desp
part10345.0
erate look back at Ron, Harry and Hermi
part10346.0
one charged through
the door and up the
part10347.0
 next passageway.

"What if he's --?"


part10348.0
"He'll be all right," said Harry, tryin
part10349.0
g to convince himself. "What do
you rec
part10350.0
kon's next?"

"We've had Sprout's, that
part10351.0
 was the Devil's Snare; Flitwick must'v
part10352.0
e put
charms on the keys; McGonagall tr
part10353.0
ansfigured the chessmen to make them
al
part10354.0
ive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and 
part10355.0
Snape's."

They had reached another doo
part10356.0
r.

"All right?" Harry whispered.

"Go 
part10357.0
on."

Harry pushed it open.

A disgusti
part10358.0
ng smell filled their nostrils, making 
part10359.0
both of them pull their
robes up over t
part10360.0
heir noses. Eyes watering, they saw, fl
part10361.0
at on the floor in
front of them, a tro
part10362.0
ll even larger than the one they had ta
part10363.0
ckled, out
cold with a bloody lump on i
part10364.0
ts head.

"I'm glad we didn't have to f
part10365.0
ight that one," Harry whispered as they
part10366.0

stepped carefully over one of its mass
part10367.0
ive legs. "Come on, I can't
breathe."


part10368.0
He pulled open the next door, both of t
part10369.0
hem hardly daring to look at what
came 
part10370.0
next - but there was nothing very frigh
part10371.0
tening in here, just a table
with seven
part10372.0
 differently shaped bottles standing on
part10373.0
 it in a line.

"Snape's," said Harry. 
part10374.0
"What do we have to do?"

They stepped 
part10375.0
over the threshold, and immediately a f
part10376.0
ire sprang up behind
them in the doorwa
part10377.0
y. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it w
part10378.0
as purple. At
the same instant, black f
part10379.0
lames shot up in the doorway leading on
part10380.0
ward.
They were trapped.

"Look!" Hermi
part10381.0
one seized a roll of paper lying next t
part10382.0
o the bottles. Harry
looked over her sh
part10383.0
oulder to read it:

Danger lies before 
part10384.0
you, while safety lies behind,

Two of 
part10385.0
us will help you, which ever you would 
part10386.0
find,

One among us seven will let you 
part10387.0
move ahead,

Another will transport the
part10388.0
 drinker back instead,

Two among our n
part10389.0
umber hold only nettle wine,

Three of 
part10390.0
us are killers, waiting bidden in line.
part10391.0


Choose, unless you wish to stay here 
part10392.0
forevermore,

To help you in your choic
part10393.0
e, we give you these clues four:

First
part10394.0
, however slyly the poison tries to hid
part10395.0
e

You will always find some on nettle 
part10396.0
wine's left side;

Second, different ar
part10397.0
e those who stand at either end,

But i
part10398.0
f you would move onward, neither is you
part10399.0
r friend;

Third, as you see clearly, a
part10400.0
ll are different size,

Neither dwarf n
part10401.0
or giant holds death in their insides;

part10402.0

Fourth, the second left and the second
part10403.0
 on the right

Are twins once you taste
part10404.0
 them, though different at first sight.
part10405.0


Hermione let out a great sigh and Har
part10406.0
ry, amazed, saw that she was
smiling, t
part10407.0
he very last thing he felt like doing.

part10408.0

"Brilliant," said Hermione. "This isn'
part10409.0
t magic -- it's logic -- a puzzle.
A lo
part10410.0
t of the greatest wizards haven't got a
part10411.0
n ounce of logic, they'd be
stuck in he
part10412.0
re forever."

"But so will we, won't we
part10413.0
?" "Of course not," said Hermione. "Eve
part10414.0
rything
we need is here on this paper. 
part10415.0
Seven bottles: three are poison; two ar
part10416.0
e
wine; one will get us safely through 
part10417.0
the black fire, and one will get us
bac
part10418.0
k through the purple."

"But how do we 
part10419.0
know which to drink?"

"Give me a minut
part10420.0
e."

Hermione read the paper several ti
part10421.0
mes. Then she walked up and down the
li
part10422.0
ne of bottles, muttering to herself and
part10423.0
 pointing at them. At last, she
clapped
part10424.0
 her hands.

"Got it," she said. "The s
part10425.0
mallest bottle will get us through the 
part10426.0
black
fire -- toward the Stone."

Harry
part10427.0
 looked at the tiny bottle.

"There's o
part10428.0
nly enough there for one of us," he sai
part10429.0
d. "That's hardly one
swallow."

They l
part10430.0
ooked at each other.

"Which one will g
part10431.0
et you back through the purple flames?"
part10432.0


Hermione pointed at a rounded bottle 
part10433.0
at the right end of the line.

"You dri
part10434.0
nk that," said Harry. "No, listen, get 
part10435.0
back and get Ron. Grab
brooms from the 
part10436.0
flying- key room, they'll get you out o
part10437.0
f the trapdoor
and past Fluffy -- go st
part10438.0
raight to the owlery and send Hedwig to
part10439.0

Dumbledore, we need him. I might be ab
part10440.0
le to hold Snape off for a while,
but I
part10441.0
'm no match for him, really."

"But Har
part10442.0
ry -- what if You-Know-Who's with him?"
part10443.0


"Well -- I was lucky once, wasn't I?"
part10444.0
 said Harry, pointing at his scar.
"I m
part10445.0
ight get lucky again."

Hermione's lip 
part10446.0
trembled, and she suddenly dashed at Ha
part10447.0
rry and threw her
arms around him.

"He
part10448.0
rmione!"

"Harry -- you're a great wiza
part10449.0
rd, you know."

"I'm not as good as you
part10450.0
," said Harry, very embarrassed, as she
part10451.0
 let go of
him.

"Me!" said Hermione. "
part10452.0
Books! And cleverness! There are more i
part10453.0
mportant
things -- friendship and brave
part10454.0
ry and -- oh Harry -- be careful!"

"Yo
part10455.0
u drink first," said Harry. "You are su
part10456.0
re which is which, aren't
you?"

"Posit
part10457.0
ive," said Hermione. She took a long dr
part10458.0
ink from the round bottle
at the end, a
part10459.0
nd shuddered.

"It's not poison?" said 
part10460.0
Harry anxiously.

"No -- but it's like 
part10461.0
ice."

"Quick, go, before it wears off.
part10462.0
"

"Good luck -- take care."

"GO!"

He
part10463.0
rmione turned and walked straight throu
part10464.0
gh the purple fire.

Harry took a deep 
part10465.0
breath and picked up the smallest bottl
part10466.0
e. He turned to
face the black flames.

part10467.0

"Here I come," he said, and he drained
part10468.0
 the little bottle in one gulp.

It was
part10469.0
 indeed as though ice was flooding his 
part10470.0
body. He put the bottle
down and walked
part10471.0
 forward; he braced himself, saw the bl
part10472.0
ack flames licking
his body, but couldn
part10473.0
't feel them -- for a moment he could s
part10474.0
ee nothing
but dark fire -- then he was
part10475.0
 on the other side, in the last chamber
part10476.0
.

There was already someone there -- b
part10477.0
ut it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even
Vold
part10478.0
emort.


CHAPTER SEVENTEEN

THE MAN WIT
part10479.0
H TWO FACES

It was Quirrell.

"You!" g
part10480.0
asped Harry.

Quirrell smiled. His face
part10481.0
 wasn't twitching at all.

"Me," he sai
part10482.0
d calmly. "I wondered whether I'd be me
part10483.0
eting you here,
Potter."

"But I though
part10484.0
t -- Snape --"

"Severus?" Quirrell lau
part10485.0
ghed, and it wasn't his usual quivering
part10486.0
 treble,
either, but cold and sharp. "Y
part10487.0
es, Severus does seem the type, doesn't
part10488.0

he? So useful to have him swooping aro
part10489.0
und like an overgrown bat. Next to
him,
part10490.0
 who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stutter
part10491.0
ing P-Professor Quirrell?"

Harry could
part10492.0
n't take it in. This couldn't be true, 
part10493.0
it couldn't.

"But Snape tried to kill 
part10494.0
me!"

"No, no, no. I tried to kill you.
part10495.0
 Your friend Miss Granger accidentally

part10496.0
knocked me over as she rushed to set fi
part10497.0
re to Snape at that Quidditch
match. Sh
part10498.0
e broke my eye contact with you. Anothe
part10499.0
r few seconds and I'd
have got you off 
part10500.0
that broom. I'd have managed it before 
part10501.0
then if Snape
hadn't been muttering a c
part10502.0
ountercurse, trying to save you."

"Sna
part10503.0
pe was trying to save me?"

"Of course,
part10504.0
" said Quirrell coolly. "\Why do you th
part10505.0
ink he wanted to
referee your next matc
part10506.0
h? He was trying to make sure I didn't 
part10507.0
do it
again. Funny, really... he needn'
part10508.0
t have bothered. I couldn't do anything
part10509.0

with Dumbledore watching. All the othe
part10510.0
r teachers thought Snape was
trying to 
part10511.0
stop Gryffindor from winning, he did ma
part10512.0
ke himself unpopular...
and what a wast
part10513.0
e of time, when after all that, I'm goi
part10514.0
ng to kill you
tonight."

Quirrell snap
part10515.0
ped his fingers. Ropes sprang out of th
part10516.0
in air and wrapped
themselves tightly a
part10517.0
round Harry.

"You're too nosy to live,
part10518.0
 Potter. Scurrying around the school on
part10519.0

Halloween like that, for all I knew yo
part10520.0
u'd seen me coming to look at what
was 
part10521.0
guarding the Stone."

"You let the trol
part10522.0
l in?"

"Certainly. I have a special gi
part10523.0
ft with trolls -- you must have seen wh
part10524.0
at
I did to the one in the chamber back
part10525.0
 there? Unfortunately, while
everyone e
part10526.0
lse was running around looking for it, 
part10527.0
Snape, who already
suspected me, went s
part10528.0
traight to the third floor to head me o
part10529.0
ff -- and not
only did my troll fail to
part10530.0
 beat you to death, that three-headed d
part10531.0
og
didn't even manage to bite Snape's l
part10532.0
eg off properly.

"Now, wait quietly, P
part10533.0
otter. I need to examine this interesti
part10534.0
ng mirror.

It was only then that Harry
part10535.0
 realized what was standing behind Quir
part10536.0
rell.
It was the Mirror of Erised.

"Th
part10537.0
is mirror is the key to finding the Sto
part10538.0
ne," Quirrell murmured,
tapping his way
part10539.0
 around the frame. "Trust Dumbledore to
part10540.0
 come up with
something like this... bu
part10541.0
t he's in London... I'll be far away by
part10542.0
 the
time he gets back...."

All Harry 
part10543.0
could think of doing was to keep Quirre
part10544.0
ll talking and stop him
from concentrat
part10545.0
ing on the mirror.

"I saw you and Snap
part10546.0
e in the forest --" he blurted out.

"Y
part10547.0
es," said Quirrell idly, walking around
part10548.0
 the mirror to look at the
back. "He wa
part10549.0
s on to me by that time, trying to find
part10550.0
 out how far I'd got.
He suspected me a
part10551.0
ll along. Tried to frighten me - as tho
part10552.0
ugh he could,
when I had Lord Voldemort
part10553.0
 on my side...."

Quirrell came back ou
part10554.0
t from behind the mirror and stared hun
part10555.0
grily into
it.

"I see the Stone... I'm
part10556.0
 presenting it to my master... but wher
part10557.0
e is it?"

Harry struggled against the 
part10558.0
ropes binding him, but they didn't give
part10559.0
. He
had to keep Quirrell from giving h
part10560.0
is whole attention to the mirror.

"But
part10561.0
 Snape always seemed to hate me so much
part10562.0
."

"Oh, he does," said Quirrell casual
part10563.0
ly, "heavens, yes. He was at Hogwarts
w
part10564.0
ith your father, didn't you know? They 
part10565.0
loathed each other. But he never
wanted
part10566.0
 you dead."

"But I heard you a few day
part10567.0
s ago, sobbing -- I thought Snape was
t
part10568.0
hreatening you...."

For the first time
part10569.0
, a spasm of fear flitted across Quirre
part10570.0
ll's face.

"Sometimes," he said, "I fi
part10571.0
nd it hard to follow my master's instru
part10572.0
ctions
-- he is a great wizard and I am
part10573.0
 weak --"

"You mean he was there in th
part10574.0
e classroom with you?" Harry gasped.

"
part10575.0
He is with me wherever I go," said Quir
part10576.0
rell quietly. "I met him when I
travele
part10577.0
d around the world. A foolish young man
part10578.0
 I was then, full of
ridiculous ideas a
part10579.0
bout good and evil. Lord Voldemort show
part10580.0
ed me how wrong
I was. There is no good
part10581.0
 and evil, there is only power, and tho
part10582.0
se too
weak to seek it.... Since then, 
part10583.0
I have served him faithfully, although 
part10584.0
I
have let him down many times. He has 
part10585.0
had to be very hard on me."
Quirrell sh
part10586.0
ivered suddenly. "He does not forgive m
part10587.0
istakes easily. When I
failed to steal 
part10588.0
the stone from Gringotts, he was most d
part10589.0
ispleased. He
punished me... decided he
part10590.0
 would have to keep a closer watch on m
part10591.0
e...."

Quirrell's voice trailed away. 
part10592.0
Harry was remembering his trip to Diago
part10593.0
n
Alley -how could he have been so stup
part10594.0
id? He'd seen Quirrell there that
very 
part10595.0
day, shaken hands with him in the Leaky
part10596.0
 Cauldron.

Quirrell cursed under his b
part10597.0
reath.

"I don't understand... is the S
part10598.0
tone inside the mirror? Should I break

part10599.0
it?"

Harry's mind was racing.

What I 
part10600.0
want more than anything else in the wor
part10601.0
ld at the moment, he
thought, is to fin
part10602.0
d the Stone before Quirrell does. So if
part10603.0
 I look in the
mirror, I should see mys
part10604.0
eff finding it -- which means I'll see 
part10605.0
where
it's hidden! But how can I look w
part10606.0
ithout Quirrell realizing what I'm up
t
part10607.0
o?

He tried to edge to the left, to ge
part10608.0
t in front of the glass without
Quirrel
part10609.0
l noticing, but the ropes around his an
part10610.0
kles were too tight: he
tripped and fel
part10611.0
l over. Quirrell ignored him. He was st
part10612.0
ill talking to
himself. "What does this
part10613.0
 mirror do? How does it work? Help me, 
part10614.0
Master!"

And to Harry's horror, a voic
part10615.0
e answered, and the voice seemed to com
part10616.0
e
from Quirrell himself

"Use the boy..
part10617.0
. Use the boy..."

Quirrell rounded on 
part10618.0
Harry.

"Yes -- Potter -- come here."


part10619.0
He clapped his hands once, and the rope
part10620.0
s binding Harry fell off. Harry
got slo
part10621.0
wly to his feet.

"Come here," Quirrell
part10622.0
 repeated. "Look in the mirror and tell
part10623.0
 me what you
see."

Harry walked toward
part10624.0
 him.

I must lie, he thought desperate
part10625.0
ly. I must look and lie about what I
se
part10626.0
e, that's all.

Quirrell moved close be
part10627.0
hind him. Harry breathed in the funny s
part10628.0
mell that
seemed to come from Quirrell'
part10629.0
s turban. He closed his eyes, stepped i
part10630.0
n
front of the mirror, and opened them 
part10631.0
again.

He saw his reflection, pale and
part10632.0
 scared-looking at first. But a moment

part10633.0
later, the reflection smiled at him. It
part10634.0
 put its hand into its pocket and
pulle
part10635.0
d out a blood-red stone. It winked and 
part10636.0
put the Stone back in its
pocket -- and
part10637.0
 as it did so, Harry felt something hea
part10638.0
vy drop into his
real pocket. Somehow -
part10639.0
- incredibly -- he'd gotten the Stone.

part10640.0

"Well?" said Quirrell impatiently. "Wh
part10641.0
at do you see?"

Harry screwed up his c
part10642.0
ourage.

"I see myself shaking hands wi
part10643.0
th Dumbledore," he invented. "I -- I've
part10644.0

won the house cup for Gryffindor."

Qu
part10645.0
irrell cursed again.

"Get out of the w
part10646.0
ay," he said. As Harry moved aside, he 
part10647.0
felt the
Sorcerer's Stone against his l
part10648.0
eg. Dare he make a break for it?

But h
part10649.0
e hadn't walked five paces before a hig
part10650.0
h voice spoke, though
Quirrell wasn't m
part10651.0
oving his lips.

"He lies... He lies...
part10652.0
"

"Potter, come back here!" Quirrell s
part10653.0
houted. "Tell me the truth! What did
yo
part10654.0
u just see?"

The high voice spoke agai
part10655.0
n.

"Let me speak to him... face-to-fac
part10656.0
e..."

"Master, you are not strong enou
part10657.0
gh!"

"I have strength enough... for th
part10658.0
is...."

Harry felt as if Devil's Snare
part10659.0
 was rooting him to the spot. He couldn
part10660.0
't
move a muscle. Petrified, he watched
part10661.0
 as Quirrell reached up and began to
un
part10662.0
wrap his turban. What was going on? The
part10663.0
 turban fell away. Quirrell's
head look
part10664.0
ed strangely small without it. Then he 
part10665.0
turned slowly on the
spot.

Harry would
part10666.0
 have screamed, but he couldn't make a 
part10667.0
sound. Where there
should have been a b
part10668.0
ack to Quirrell's head, there was a fac
part10669.0
e, the most
terrible face Harry had eve
part10670.0
r seen. It was chalk white with glaring
part10671.0
 red
eyes and slits for nostrils, like 
part10672.0
a snake.

"Harry Potter..." it whispere
part10673.0
d.

Harry tried to take a step backward
part10674.0
 but his legs wouldn't move.

"See what
part10675.0
 I have become?" the face said. "Mere s
part10676.0
hadow and vapor ... I
have form only wh
part10677.0
en I can share another's body... but th
part10678.0
ere have always
been those willing to l
part10679.0
et me into their hearts and minds.... U
part10680.0
nicorn
blood has strengthened me, these
part10681.0
 past weeks... you saw faithful Quirrel
part10682.0
l
drinking it for me in the forest... a
part10683.0
nd once I have the Elixir of Life,
I wi
part10684.0
ll be able to create a body of my own..
part10685.0
.. Now... why don't you give
me that St
part10686.0
one in your pocket?"

So he knew. The f
part10687.0
eeling suddenly surged back into Harry'
part10688.0
s legs. He
stumbled backward.

"Don't b
part10689.0
e a fool," snarled the face. "Better sa
part10690.0
ve your own life and join
me... or you'
part10691.0
ll meet the same end as your parents...
part10692.0
. They died begging
me for mercy..."

"
part10693.0
LIAR!" Harry shouted suddenly.

Quirrel
part10694.0
l was walking backward at him, so that 
part10695.0
Voldemort could still see
him. The evil
part10696.0
 face was now smiling.

"How touching..
part10697.0
." it hissed. "I always value bravery..
part10698.0
. Yes, boy, your
parents were brave....
part10699.0
 I killed your father first; and he put
part10700.0
 up a
courageous fight... but your moth
part10701.0
er needn't have died... she was trying

part10702.0
to protect you.... Now give me the Ston
part10703.0
e, unless you want her to have
died in 
part10704.0
vain."

"NEVER!"

Harry sprang toward t
part10705.0
he flame door, but Voldemort screamed "
part10706.0
SEIZE HIM!"
and the next second, Harry 
part10707.0
felt Quirrell's hand close on his wrist
part10708.0
. At
once, a needle-sharp pain seared a
part10709.0
cross Harry's scar; his head felt as
th
part10710.0
ough it was about to split in two; he y
part10711.0
elled, struggling with all his
might, a
part10712.0
nd to his surprise, Quirrell let go of 
part10713.0
him. The pain in his head
lessened -- h
part10714.0
e looked around wildly to see where Qui
part10715.0
rrell had gone, and
saw him hunched in 
part10716.0
pain, looking at his fingers -- they we
part10717.0
re blistering
before his eyes.

"Seize 
part10718.0
him! SEIZE HIM!" shrieked Voldemort aga
part10719.0
in, and Quirrell lunged,
knocking Harry
part10720.0
 clean off his feet' landing on top of 
part10721.0
him, both hands
around Harry's neck -- 
part10722.0
Harry's scar was almost blinding him wi
part10723.0
th pain,
yet he could see Quirrell howl
part10724.0
ing in agony.

"Master, I cannot hold h
part10725.0
im -- my hands -- my hands!"

And Quirr
part10726.0
ell, though pinning Harry to the ground
part10727.0
 with his knees, let go
of his neck and
part10728.0
 stared, bewildered, at his own palms -
part10729.0
- Harry could see
they looked burned, r
part10730.0
aw, red, and shiny.

"Then kill him, fo
part10731.0
ol, and be done!" screeched Voldemort.

part10732.0

Quirrell raised his hand to perform a 
part10733.0
deadly curse, but Harry, by
instinct, r
part10734.0
eached up and grabbed Quirrell's face -
part10735.0
-

"AAAARGH!"

Quirrell rolled off him,
part10736.0
 his face blistering, too, and then Har
part10737.0
ry knew:
Quirrell couldn't touch his ba
part10738.0
re skin, not without suffering terrible
part10739.0

pain -- his only chance was to keep ho
part10740.0
ld of Quirrell, keep him in enough
pain
part10741.0
 to stop him from doing a curse.

Harry
part10742.0
 jumped to his feet, caught Quirrell by
part10743.0
 the arm, and hung on as
tight as he co
part10744.0
uld. Quirrell screamed and tried to thr
part10745.0
ow Harry off -- the
pain in Harry's hea
part10746.0
d was building -- he couldn't see -- he
part10747.0
 could only
hear Quirrell's terrible sh
part10748.0
rieks and Voldemort's yells of, "KILL H
part10749.0
IM!
KILL HIM!" and other voices, maybe 
part10750.0
in Harry's own head, crying, "Harry!
Ha
part10751.0
rry!"

He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched 
part10752.0
from his grasp, knew all was lost, and

part10753.0
fell into blackness, down ... down... d
part10754.0
own...

Something gold was glinting jus
part10755.0
t above him. The Snitch! He tried to
ca
part10756.0
tch it, but his arms were too heavy.

H
part10757.0
e blinked. It wasn't the Snitch at all.
part10758.0
 It was a pair of glasses. How
strange.
part10759.0


He blinked again. The smiling face of
part10760.0
 Albus Dumbledore swam into view
above 
part10761.0
him.

"Good afternoon, Harry," said Dum
part10762.0
bledore. Harry stared at him. Then he
r
part10763.0
emembered: "Sir! The Stone! It was Quir
part10764.0
rell! He's got the Stone! Sir,
quick --
part10765.0
"

"Calm yourself, dear boy, you are a 
part10766.0
little behind the times," said
Dumbledo
part10767.0
re. "Quirrell does not have the Stone."
part10768.0


"Then who does? Sir, I --"

"Harry, p
part10769.0
lease relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have
part10770.0
 me thrown out.

Harry swallowed and lo
part10771.0
oked around him. He realized he must be
part10772.0
 in the
hospital wing. He was lying in 
part10773.0
a bed with white linen sheets, and next
part10774.0

to him was a table piled high with wha
part10775.0
t looked like half the candy shop.

"To
part10776.0
kens from your friends and admirers," s
part10777.0
aid Dumbledore, beaming. "What
happened
part10778.0
 down in the dungeons between you and P
part10779.0
rofessor Quirrell is a
complete secret,
part10780.0
 so, naturally, the whole school knows.
part10781.0
 I believe your
friends Misters Fred an
part10782.0
d George Weasley were responsible for t
part10783.0
rying to
send you a toilet seat. No dou
part10784.0
bt they thought it would amuse you. Mad
part10785.0
am
Pomfrey, however, felt it might not 
part10786.0
be very hygienic, and confiscated
it."

part10787.0

"How long have I been in here?"

"Thre
part10788.0
e days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Gra
part10789.0
nger will be most relieved
you have com
part10790.0
e round, they have been extremely worri
part10791.0
ed."

"But sit, the Stone

I see you ar
part10792.0
e not to be distracted. Very well, the 
part10793.0
Stone. Professor
Quirrell did not manag
part10794.0
e to take it from you. I arrived in tim
part10795.0
e to
prevent that, although you were do
part10796.0
ing very well on your own, I must say.

part10797.0

"You got there? You got Hermione's owl
part10798.0
?"

"We must have crossed in midair. No
part10799.0
 sooner had I reached London than it
be
part10800.0
came clear to me that the place I shoul
part10801.0
d be was the one I had just
left. I arr
part10802.0
ived just in time to pull Quirrell off 
part10803.0
you."

"It was you."

"I feared I might
part10804.0
 be too late."

"You nearly were, I cou
part10805.0
ldn't have kept him off the Stone much 
part10806.0
longer --"

"Not the Stone, boy, you --
part10807.0
 the effort involved nearly killed you.
part10808.0
 For
one terrible moment there, I was a
part10809.0
fraid it had. As for the Stone, it has

part10810.0
been destroyed."

"Destroyed?" said Har
part10811.0
ry blankly. "But your friend -- Nicolas
part10812.0
 Flamel --"

"Oh, you know about Nicola
part10813.0
s?" said Dumbledore, sounding quite del
part10814.0
ighted.
"You did do the thing properly,
part10815.0
 didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have h
part10816.0
ad
a little chat, and agreed it's all f
part10817.0
or the best."

"But that means he and h
part10818.0
is wife will die, won't they?"

"They h
part10819.0
ave enough Elixir stored to set their a
part10820.0
ffairs in order and then,
yes, they wil
part10821.0
l die."

Dumbledore smiled at the look 
part10822.0
of amazement on Harry's face.

"To one 
part10823.0
as young as you, I'm sure it seems incr
part10824.0
edible, but to Nicolas
and Perenelle, i
part10825.0
t really is like going to bed after a v
part10826.0
ery, very long
day. After all, to the w
part10827.0
ell-organized mind, death is but the ne
part10828.0
xt great
adventure. You know, the Stone
part10829.0
 was really not such a wonderful thing.
part10830.0
 As
much money and life as you could wa
part10831.0
nt! The two things most human beings
wo
part10832.0
uld choose above all -- the trouble is,
part10833.0
 humans do have a knack of
choosing pre
part10834.0
cisely those things that are worst for 
part10835.0
them." Harry lay
there, lost for words.
part10836.0
 Dumbledore hummed a little and smiled 
part10837.0
at the
ceiling.

"Sir?" said Harry. "I'
part10838.0
ve been thinking... sir -- even if the 
part10839.0
Stone's
gone, Vol-, I mean, You-Know- W
part10840.0
ho --"

"Call him Voldemort, Harry. Alw
part10841.0
ays use the proper name for things. Fea
part10842.0
r
of a name increases fear of the thing
part10843.0
 itself."

"Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's
part10844.0
 going to try other ways of coming back
part10845.0
,
isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has
part10846.0
 he?"

"No, Harry, he has not. He is st
part10847.0
ill out there somewhere, perhaps lookin
part10848.0
g
for another body to share... not bein
part10849.0
g truly alive, he cannot be killed.
He 
part10850.0
left Quirrell to die; he shows just as 
part10851.0
little mercy to his followers
as his en
part10852.0
emies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you m
part10853.0
ay only have delayed his
return to powe
part10854.0
r, it will merely take someone else who
part10855.0
 is prepared to
fight what seems a losi
part10856.0
ng battle next time -- and if he is del
part10857.0
ayed
again, and again, why, he may neve
part10858.0
r return to power."

Harry nodded, but 
part10859.0
stopped quickly, because it made his he
part10860.0
ad hurt. Then
he said, "Sir, there are 
part10861.0
some other things I'd like to know, if 
part10862.0
you can
tell me... things I want to kno
part10863.0
w the truth about...."

"The truth." Du
part10864.0
mbledore sighed. "It is a beautiful and
part10865.0
 terrible thing,
and should therefore b
part10866.0
e treated with great caution. However, 
part10867.0
I shall
answer your questions unless I 
part10868.0
have a very good reason not to, in whic
part10869.0
h
case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall
part10870.0
 not, of course, lie."

"Well... Voldem
part10871.0
ort said that he only killed my mother 
part10872.0
because she tried
to stop him from kill
part10873.0
ing me. But why would he want to kill m
part10874.0
e in the
first place?"

Dumbledore sigh
part10875.0
ed very deeply this time.

"Alas, the f
part10876.0
irst thing you ask me, I cannot tell yo
part10877.0
u. Not today. Not
now. You will know, o
part10878.0
ne day... put it from your mind for now
part10879.0
, Harry.
When you are older... I know y
part10880.0
ou hate to hear this... when you are
re
part10881.0
ady, you will know."

And Harry knew it
part10882.0
 would be no good to argue.

"But why c
part10883.0
ouldn't Quirrell touch me?"

"Your moth
part10884.0
er died to save you. If there is one th
part10885.0
ing Voldemort cannot
understand, it is 
part10886.0
love. He didn't realize that love as po
part10887.0
werful as your
mother's for you leaves 
part10888.0
its own mark. Not a scar, no visible si
part10889.0
gn... to
have been loved so deeply, eve
part10890.0
n though the person who loved us is gon
part10891.0
e,
will give us some protection forever
part10892.0
. It is in your very skin. Quirrell,
fu
part10893.0
ll of hatred, greed, and ambition, shar
part10894.0
ing his soul with Voldemort,
could not 
part10895.0
touch you for this reason. It was agony
part10896.0
 to touch a person
marked by something 
part10897.0
so good."

Dumbledore now became very i
part10898.0
nterested in a bird out on the windowsi
part10899.0
ll,
which gave Harry time to dry his ey
part10900.0
es on the sheet. When he had found
his 
part10901.0
voice again, Harry said, "And the invis
part10902.0
ibility cloak - do you know
who sent it
part10903.0
 to me?"

"Ah - your father happened to
part10904.0
 leave it in my possession, and I thoug
part10905.0
ht
you might like it." Dumbledore's eye
part10906.0
s twinkled. "Useful things... your
fath
part10907.0
er used it mainly for sneaking off to t
part10908.0
he kitchens to steal food
when he was h
part10909.0
ere."

"And there's something else..."

part10910.0

"Fire away."

"Quirrell said Snape --"
part10911.0


"Professor Snape, Harry." "Yes, him -
part10912.0
- Quirrell said he hates me because
he 
part10913.0
hated my father. Is that true?"

"Well,
part10914.0
 they did rather detest each other. Not
part10915.0
 unlike yourself and Mr.
Malfoy. And th
part10916.0
en, your father did something Snape cou
part10917.0
ld never forgive."

"What?"

"He saved 
part10918.0
his life."

"What?"

"Yes..." said Dumb
part10919.0
ledore dreamily. "Funny, the way people
part10920.0
's minds work,
isn't it? Professor Snap
part10921.0
e couldn't bear being in your father's 
part10922.0
debt....
I do believe he worked so hard
part10923.0
 to protect you this year because he fe
part10924.0
lt
that would make him and your father 
part10925.0
even. Then he could go back to
hating y
part10926.0
our father's memory in peace...."

Harr
part10927.0
y tried to understand this but it made 
part10928.0
his head pound, so he
stopped.

"And si
part10929.0
r, there's one more thing..."

"Just th
part10930.0
e one?"

"How did I get the Stone out o
part10931.0
f the mirror?"

"Ah, now, I'm glad you 
part10932.0
asked me that. It was one of my more br
part10933.0
illiant
ideas, and between you and me, 
part10934.0
that's saying something. You see, only

part10935.0
one who wanted to find the Stone -- fin
part10936.0
d it, but not use it -- would be
able t
part10937.0
o get it, otherwise they'd just see the
part10938.0
mselves making gold or
drinking Elixir 
part10939.0
of Life. My brain surprises even me som
part10940.0
etimes.... Now,
enough questions. I sug
part10941.0
gest you make a start on these sweets. 
part10942.0
Ah! Bettie
Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I
part10943.0
 was unfortunate enough in my youth to 
part10944.0
come
across a vomitflavored one, and si
part10945.0
nce then I'm afraid I've rather lost
my
part10946.0
 liking for them -- but I think I'll be
part10947.0
 safe with a nice toffee, don't
you?"


part10948.0
He smiled and popped the golden-brown b
part10949.0
ean into his mouth. Then he
choked and 
part10950.0
said, "Alas! Ear wax!"

Madam Pomfrey, 
part10951.0
the nurse, was a nice woman, but very s
part10952.0
trict.

"Just five minutes," Harry plea
part10953.0
ded.

"Absolutely not."

"You let Profe
part10954.0
ssor Dumbledore in..."

"Well, of cours
part10955.0
e, that was the headmaster, quite diffe
part10956.0
rent. You need
rest."

"I am resting, l
part10957.0
ook, lying down and everything. Oh, go 
part10958.0
on, Madam
Pomfrey..."

"Oh, very well,"
part10959.0
 she said. "But five minutes only."

An
part10960.0
d she let Ron and Hermione in.

"Harry!
part10961.0
"

Hermione looked ready to fling her a
part10962.0
rms around him again, but Harry was
gla
part10963.0
d she held herself in as his head was s
part10964.0
till very sore.

"Oh, Harry, we were su
part10965.0
re you were going to -- Dumbledore was 
part10966.0
so worried
--"

"The whole school's tal
part10967.0
king about it," said Ron. "What really 
part10968.0
happened?"

It was one of those rare oc
part10969.0
casions when the true story is even mor
part10970.0
e
strange and exciting than the wild ru
part10971.0
mors. Harry told them everything:
Quirr
part10972.0
ell; the mirror; the Stone; and Voldemo
part10973.0
rt. Ron and Hermione were a
very good a
part10974.0
udience; they gasped in all the right p
part10975.0
laces, and when Harry
told them what wa
part10976.0
s under Quirrell's turban, Hermione scr
part10977.0
eamed out loud.

"So the Stone's gone?"
part10978.0
 said Ron finally. "Flamel's just going
part10979.0
 to die?"

"That's what I said, but Dum
part10980.0
bledore thinks that -- what was it? -- 
part10981.0
'to
the well-organized mind, death is b
part10982.0
ut the next great adventure.

"I always
part10983.0
 said he was off his rocker," said Ron,
part10984.0
 looking quite impressed
at how crazy h
part10985.0
is hero was.

"So what happened to you 
part10986.0
two?" said Harry.

"Well, I got back al
part10987.0
l right," said Hermione. "I brought Ron
part10988.0
 round --
that took a while -- and we w
part10989.0
ere dashing up to the owlery to contact
part10990.0

Dumbledore when we met him in the entr
part10991.0
ance hall -- he already knew -- he
just
part10992.0
 said, 'Harry's gone after him, hasn't 
part10993.0
he?' and hurtled off to the
third floor
part10994.0
."

"D'you think he meant you to do it?
part10995.0
" said Ron. "Sending you your
father's 
part10996.0
cloak and everything?"

"Well, " Hermio
part10997.0
ne exploded, "if he did -- I mean to sa
part10998.0
y that's terrible
-- you could have bee
part10999.0
n killed."

"No, it isn't," said Harry 
part11000.0
thoughtfully. "He's a funny man, Dumble
part11001.0
dore.
I think he sort of wanted to give
part11002.0
 me a chance. I think he knows more or

part11003.0
less everything that goes on here, you 
part11004.0
know. I reckon he had a pretty
good ide
part11005.0
a we were going to try, and instead of 
part11006.0
stopping us, he just
taught us enough t
part11007.0
o help. I don't think it was an acciden
part11008.0
t he let me
find out how the mirror wor
part11009.0
ked. It's almost like he thought I had 
part11010.0
the
right to face Voldemort if I could.
part11011.0
..."

"Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocke
part11012.0
r, all right," said Ron proudly.
"Liste
part11013.0
n, you've got to be up for the end-of-y
part11014.0
ear feast tomorrow. The
points are all 
part11015.0
in and Slytherin won, of course -- you 
part11016.0
missed the last
Quidditch match, we wer
part11017.0
e steamrollered by Ravenclaw without yo
part11018.0
u -- but
the food'll be good."

At that
part11019.0
 moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.

"
part11020.0
You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now 
part11021.0
OUT" she said firmly.

After a good nig
part11022.0
ht's sleep, Harry felt nearly back to n
part11023.0
ormal.

I want to go to the feast," he 
part11024.0
told Madam Pomfrey as she straightened

part11025.0
his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?"

part11026.0

"Professor Dumbledore says you are to 
part11027.0
be allowed to go," she said
stiffily, a
part11028.0
s though in her opinion Professor Dumbl
part11029.0
edore didn't realize
how risky feasts c
part11030.0
ould be. "And you have another visitor.
part11031.0
"

"Oh, good," said Harry. "Who is it?"
part11032.0


Hagrid sidled through the door as he 
part11033.0
spoke. As usual when he was
indoors, Ha
part11034.0
grid looked too big to be allowed. He s
part11035.0
at down next to Harry,
took one look at
part11036.0
 him, and burst into tears.

"It's -- a
part11037.0
ll -- my -- ruddy -- fault!" he sobbed,
part11038.0
 his face in his hands.
I told the evil
part11039.0
 git how ter get past Fluffy! I told hi
part11040.0
m! It was the only
thing he didn't know
part11041.0
, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! Al
part11042.0
l fer a
dragon egg! I'll never drink ag
part11043.0
ain! I should be chucked out an' made t
part11044.0
er
live as a Muggle!"

"Hagrid!" said H
part11045.0
arry, shocked to see Hagrid shaking wit
part11046.0
h grief and
remorse, great tears leakin
part11047.0
g down into his beard. "Hagrid, he'd ha
part11048.0
ve
found out somehow, this is Voldemort
part11049.0
 we're talking about, he'd have
found o
part11050.0
ut even if you hadn't told him."

"Yeh 
part11051.0
could've died!" sobbed Hagrid. "An' don
part11052.0
' say the name!"

"VOLDEMORT!" Harry be
part11053.0
llowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he s
part11054.0
topped
crying. "I've met him and I'm ca
part11055.0
lling him by his name. Please cheer up,
part11056.0

Hagrid, we saved the Stone, it's gone,
part11057.0
 he can't use it. Have a Chocolate
Frog
part11058.0
, I've got loads...."

Hagrid wiped his
part11059.0
 nose on the back of his hand and said,
part11060.0
 "That reminds
me. I've got yeh a prese
part11061.0
nt."

"It's not a stoat sandwich, is it
part11062.0
?" said Harry anxiously, and at last
Ha
part11063.0
grid gave a weak chuckle. "Nah. Dumbled
part11064.0
ore gave me the day off
yesterday ter f
part11065.0
ix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me in
part11066.0
stead -- anyway,
got yeh this..."

It s
part11067.0
eemed to be a handsome, leather-covered
part11068.0
 book. Harry opened it
curiously. It wa
part11069.0
s full of wizard photographs. Smiling a
part11070.0
nd waving at him
from every page were h
part11071.0
is mother and father.

"Sent owls off t
part11072.0
er all yer parents' old school friends,
part11073.0
 askin' fer
photos... knew yeh didn' ha
part11074.0
ve any... d'yeh like it?"

Harry couldn
part11075.0
't speak, but Hagrid understood.

Harry
part11076.0
 made his way down to the end-of-year f
part11077.0
east alone that night. He
had been held
part11078.0
 up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, i
part11079.0
nsisting on giving
him one last checkup
part11080.0
, so the Great Hall was already full. I
part11081.0
t was decked
out in the Slytherin color
part11082.0
s of green and silver to celebrate Slyt
part11083.0
herin's
winning the house cup for the s
part11084.0
eventh year in a row. A huge banner
sho
part11085.0
wing the Slytherin serpent covered the 
part11086.0
wall behind the High Table.

When Harry
part11087.0
 walked in there was a sudden hush, and
part11088.0
 then everybody started
talking loudly 
part11089.0
at once. He slipped into a seat between
part11090.0
 Ron and Hermione
at the Gryffindor tab
part11091.0
le and tried to ignore the fact that pe
part11092.0
ople were
standing up to look at him.


part11093.0
Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments
part11094.0
 later. The babble died away.

"Another
part11095.0
 year gone!" Dumbledore said cheerfully
part11096.0
. "And I must trouble you
with an old m
part11097.0
an's wheezing waffle before we sink our
part11098.0
 teeth into our
delicious feast. What a
part11099.0
 year it has been! Hopefully your heads
part11100.0
 are all a
little fuller than they were
part11101.0
... you have the whole summer ahead to 
part11102.0
get
them nice and empty before next yea
part11103.0
r starts....

"Now, as I understand it,
part11104.0
 the house cup here needs awarding, and
part11105.0
 the
points stand thus: In fourth place
part11106.0
, Gryffindor, with three hundred and
tw
part11107.0
elve points; in third, Hufflepuff, with
part11108.0
 three hundred and fifty-two;
Ravenclaw
part11109.0
 has four hundred and twenty-six and Sl
part11110.0
ytherin, four hundred
and seventy- two.
part11111.0
"

A storm of cheering and stamping bro
part11112.0
ke out from the Slytherin table.
Harry 
part11113.0
could see Draco Malfoy banging his gobl
part11114.0
et on the table. It was a
sickening sig
part11115.0
ht.

"Yes, Yes, well done, Slytherin," 
part11116.0
said Dumbledore. "However, recent
event
part11117.0
s must be taken into account."

The roo
part11118.0
m went very still. The Slytherins' smil
part11119.0
es faded a little.

"Ahem," said Dumble
part11120.0
dore. "I have a few last-minute points 
part11121.0
to dish out.
Let me see. Yes...

"First
part11122.0
 -- to Mr. Ronald Weasley..."

Ron went
part11123.0
 purple in the face; he looked like a r
part11124.0
adish with a bad sunburn.

"...for the 
part11125.0
best-played game of chess Hogwarts has 
part11126.0
seen in many years, I
award Gryffindor 
part11127.0
house fifty points."

Gryffindor cheers
part11128.0
 nearly raised the bewitched ceiling; t
part11129.0
he stars
overhead seemed to quiver. Per
part11130.0
cy could be heard telling the other
pre
part11131.0
fects, "My brother, you know! My younge
part11132.0
st brother! Got past
McGonagall's giant
part11133.0
 chess set!"

At last there was silence
part11134.0
 again.

"Second -- to Miss Hermione Gr
part11135.0
anger... for the use of cool logic in t
part11136.0
he
face of fire, I award Gryffindor hou
part11137.0
se fifty points."

Hermione buried her 
part11138.0
face in her arms; Harry strongly suspec
part11139.0
ted she had
burst into tears. Gryffindo
part11140.0
rs up and down the table were beside
th
part11141.0
emselves -- they were a hundred points 
part11142.0
up. "Third -- to Mr. Harry
Potter..." s
part11143.0
aid Dumbledore. The room went deadly qu
part11144.0
iet for pure nerve
and outstanding cour
part11145.0
age, I award Gryffindor house sixty poi
part11146.0
nts."

The din was deafening. Those who
part11147.0
 could add up while yelling themselves

part11148.0
hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had fou
part11149.0
r hundred and seventy-two points
-- exa
part11150.0
ctly the same as Slytherin. They had ti
part11151.0
ed for the house cup -- if
only Dumbled
part11152.0
ore had given Harry just one more point
part11153.0
.

Dumbledore raised his hand. The room
part11154.0
 gradually fell silent.

"There are all
part11155.0
 kinds of courage," said Dumbledore, sm
part11156.0
iling. "It takes a
great deal of braver
part11157.0
y to stand up to our enemies, but just 
part11158.0
as much to
stand up to our friends. I t
part11159.0
herefore award ten points to Mr. Nevill
part11160.0
e
Longbottom."

Someone standing outsid
part11161.0
e the Great Hall might well have though
part11162.0
t some
sort of explosion had taken plac
part11163.0
e, so loud was the noise that erupted
f
part11164.0
rom the Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, a
part11165.0
nd Hermione stood up to yell and
cheer 
part11166.0
as Neville, white with shock, disappear
part11167.0
ed under a pile of people
hugging him. 
part11168.0
He had never won so much as a point for
part11169.0
 Gryffindor before.
Harry, still cheeri
part11170.0
ng, nudged Ron in the ribs and pointed 
part11171.0
at Malfoy, who
couldn't have looked mor
part11172.0
e stunned and horrified if he'd just ha
part11173.0
d the
Body-Bind Curse put on him.

"Whi
part11174.0
ch means, Dumbledore called over the st
part11175.0
orm of applause, for even
Ravenclaw and
part11176.0
 Hufflepuff were celebrating the downfa
part11177.0
ll of Slytherin, "we
need a little chan
part11178.0
ge of decoration."

He clapped his hand
part11179.0
s. In an instant, the green hangings be
part11180.0
came scarlet
and the silver became gold
part11181.0
; the huge Slytherin serpent vanished a
part11182.0
nd a
towering Gryffindor lion took its 
part11183.0
place. Snape was shaking Professor
McGo
part11184.0
nagall's hand, with a horrible, forced 
part11185.0
smile. He caught Harry's eye
and Harry 
part11186.0
knew at once that Snape's feelings towa
part11187.0
rd him hadn't changed
one jot. This did
part11188.0
n't worry Harry. It seemed as though li
part11189.0
fe would be back
to normal next year, o
part11190.0
r as normal as it ever was at Hogwarts.
part11191.0


It was the best evening of Harry's li
part11192.0
fe, better than winning at
Quidditch, o
part11193.0
r Christmas, or knocking out mountain t
part11194.0
rolls... he would
never, ever forget to
part11195.0
night.

Harry had almost forgotten that
part11196.0
 the exam results were still to come, b
part11197.0
ut
come they did. To their great surpri
part11198.0
se, both he and Ron passed with good
ma
part11199.0
rks; Hermione, of course, had the best 
part11200.0
grades of the first years. Even
Neville
part11201.0
 scraped through, his good Herbology ma
part11202.0
rk making up for his
abysmal Potions on
part11203.0
e. They had hoped that Goyle, who was a
part11204.0
lmost as stupid
as he was mean, might b
part11205.0
e thrown out, but he had passed, too. I
part11206.0
t was a
shame, but as Ron said, you cou
part11207.0
ldn't have everything in life.

And sud
part11208.0
denly, their wardrobes were empty, thei
part11209.0
r trunks were packed,
Neville's toad wa
part11210.0
s found lurking in a corner of the toil
part11211.0
ets; notes were
handed out to all stude
part11212.0
nts, warning them not to use magic over
part11213.0
 the
holidays ("I always hope they'll f
part11214.0
orget to give us these," said Fred
Weas
part11215.0
ley sadly); Hagrid was there to take th
part11216.0
em down to the fleet of boats
that sail
part11217.0
ed across the lake; they were boarding 
part11218.0
the Hogwarts Express;
talking and laugh
part11219.0
ing as the countryside became greener a
part11220.0
nd tidier;
eating Bettie Bott's Every F
part11221.0
lavor Beans as they sped past Muggle to
part11222.0
wns;
pulling off their wizard robes and
part11223.0
 putting on jackets and coats; pulling

part11224.0
into platform nine and three-quarters a
part11225.0
t King's Cross Station.

It took quite 
part11226.0
a while for them all to get off the pla
part11227.0
tform. A wizened
old guard was up by th
part11228.0
e ticket barrier, letting them go throu
part11229.0
gh the gate
in twos and threes so they 
part11230.0
didn't attract attention by all burstin
part11231.0
g out
of a solid wall at once and alarm
part11232.0
ing the Muggles.

"You must come and st
part11233.0
ay this summer," said Ron, "both of you
part11234.0
 -- I'll
send you an owl."

"Thanks," s
part11235.0
aid Harry, "I'll need something to look
part11236.0
 forward to." People
jostled them as th
part11237.0
ey moved forward toward the gateway bac
part11238.0
k to the Muggle
world. Some of them cal
part11239.0
led:

"Bye, Harry!"

"See you, Potter!"
part11240.0


"Still famous," said Ron, grinning at
part11241.0
 him.

"Not where I'm going, I promise 
part11242.0
you," said Harry.

He, Ron, and Hermion
part11243.0
e passed through the gateway together. 
part11244.0
"There he is,
Mom, there he is, look!"

part11245.0

It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger si
part11246.0
ster, but she wasn't pointing at
Ron.


part11247.0
"Harry Potter!" she squealed. "Look, Mo
part11248.0
m! I can see

"Be quiet, Ginny, and it'
part11249.0
s rude to point."

Mrs. Weasley smiled 
part11250.0
down at them.

"Busy year?" she said.


part11251.0
"Very," said Harry. "Thanks for the fud
part11252.0
ge and the sweater, Mrs.
Weasley."

"Oh
part11253.0
, it was nothing, dear."

"Ready, are y
part11254.0
ou?"

It was Uncle Vernon, still purple
part11255.0
-faced, still mustached, still looking

part11256.0
furious at the nerve of Harry, carrying
part11257.0
 an owl in a cage in a station
full of 
part11258.0
ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt 
part11259.0
Petunia and Dudley,
looking terrified a
part11260.0
t the very sight of Harry.

"You must b
part11261.0
e Harry's family!" said Mrs. Weasley.


part11262.0
