Aerial combat brings a thrilling new
 dimension to the Napoleonic Wars as
 valiant warriors
 rise to Britain¡¯s defense by taking
 to the skies . . . not aboard aircraft
 but atop the
 mighty backs of fighting dragons.

When HMS Reliant captures a French 
frigate and seizes its precious cargo,
 an unhatched dragon egg,
 fate sweeps Capt. Will Laurence from
 his seafaring life into an uncertain 
future?and an unexpected
 kinship with a most extraordinary creature.
 Thrust into the rarified world of the Aerial
 Corps as
 master of the dragon Temeraire, he will face
 a crash course in the daring tactics of
 airborne battle.
 For as France¡¯s own dragon-borne forces
 rally to breach British soil in Bonaparte¡¯s
 boldest gambit,
 Laurence and Temeraire must soar into their
 own baptism of fire.
